“So, you’re one of those. The kind of hero who thinks if your girls‘ safe you actually have a shot at taking me down? Well I have news for you.” – Nnoitra
“Every f*ckin’ one of ’em, they have the gall to take pity on me. And they don’t even know how much they’re hurtin’ me by doin’ it. I don’t do “mercy”. Strong, weak, infant, monster. I just smash ’em all to pieces. I don’t give ’em the chance to get up a second time.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“This is a battle. Of course it’s gonna be unfair. That which is called ‘battle’ was a monster originally born of unfairness and intolerance. I can’t stand that guy. I can beat that guy. I can’t forgive that guy. We make enemies for all sorts of reasons, and from the moment you make an enemy, until one of you draws his last breath – you’re in a battle.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“Oh, I’ve got purpose all right. I fight for the sake of fighting.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“I wanna be cut so that my breath is gone before my body hits the ground. That’s the kind of death I wanna have.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“Ain’t no chance of salvation for us. Never has been. With or without Aizen, that’s never gonna change. If there’s one thing I’m grateful to that guy for, it’s the fact that he gave me power. Thanks to that, I’ve been able to savor greater battles than ever before. I’m gonna be strong. Stronger than anyone.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“We’ve only been separated for a little while, but it looks like you’ve got annoying in a totally different way. You’re just pathetic.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“I just can’t freakin’ stand it. On the battlefield, a woman standin’ above the men. That’s all it is.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“There is not a single person in heaven or on earth that can break me. Don’t forget that I am the strongest Espada.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“If I kill a thousand nobodies, who’s gonna admit that I’m the strongest? There’s no value in taking a nobody’s life.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“I want to die in the heat of battle. That’s why I wanna get stronger. The stronger I get, the more battle will surround me. I want to be able to live and breathe the heat of battle.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“Ya know, I hate idiots who keep on comin’ at ya even though there’s no way they’re gonna win.” – Nnoitra Gilga
“Hah! What the hell’re you blathering about?! Dodgin’ attacks is a pure battle instinct! And there ain’t nowhere you can cut me! That sword of yours can never cut me! That’s all there is to it.” – Nnoitra Gilga“Naturally, you don’t know since you don’t live here in Reverse London, but direct contact with a Dragon is a felony! Right now, you’ll be fine as long as I keep quiet. So hand it over! I’m telling you this for your own sake! If they find out, you’ll wind up dead!” – Ninny Spangcole
“I don’t want to do it. Managing a Dragonclad is just some nonsense HQ is forcing on us. We’re not getting paid nearly enough money or achievement points to watch him 24/7 while holding down a normal job!” – Ninny Spangcole
“Honestly, I think they got the right idea over in Japan. They just kill them all, no questions asked.” – Ninny Spangcole

“Of course they should fix the screen first! Everyone wants to see my commercial!” – Ninnny Spangcole
“Aren’t fairy tales just full of it? Girl gets hit by a magic spell, turns into a princess, gets to wear a pretty dress, gets to make believe she’s picking out some hot guy, but ends up getting chosen herself instead. And the magic disappears partway through, to boot. Isn’t that just the worst? But everyone says they want to be the princess. Are they for real? They know the spell’s gonna wear off in the middle of things, right? You broke a promise, so…oh, well? Time’s up, so you’re out of luck? Think again. You’re all a bunch of idiots. None of you have any idea why the spell actually wears off. If idiots are the only ones who get bewitched…I’d rather be the one casting the spell.” – Ninny Spangcole
“You and everybody else have no idea why the spell wears off. But the reason it fades partway through is because the power was never yours. Macy, we’re the ones who cast the magic, aren’t we?” – Ninny Spangcole
“I’m not upset because I don’t get it! I’m mad because I’m unhappy! You’d be mad too if you got stuck with taking care of the class pet frog after drawing the short straw, wouldn’t you?! I’d still do it anyway, though! That’s the kind of upset I am!” – Ninny Spangcole
“It’s our time to shine, Niiha! You’re doing it for the money! I’m doing it for the achievements! And if anybody asks, we’re doing it for social justice!” – Ninny Spangcole
“I already told you, that isn’t going to work. No matter how much you love them, you just can’t reach someone you can’t get through to. How long are you going to keep insisting that the Dragon will give you strength or that it’ll take you somewhere special? Can you stop talking like this is a fairy tale?” – Ninny S[angcole
“Niihaaaa! Why’re today’s Wing Bind Headliners about you instead of me? I obviously did more than you!” – Ninny Spangcole

“Why do I have to fight with such a strong guy? I envied the weak ones. The souls of everyone in our group of friends wasted away and disappeared just from being around us. From loneliness we divided our soul in two. We don’t know which was the original, or maybe it was neither of us. It’s just that there was no other way to escape from the loneliness. I envied the weak ones. If you’re weak, then you can gather in as large a group as you want. I want to become weak and if that’s not possible, then I at least want to make friends that are as strong as me.” – Coyote Starrk
“I’m not alone. I’m not alone. I’m not alone any more.” – Coyte Starrk

“The two of us are one. When we evolved from Hollow into Arrancar, we divided the Hollow power that the other Arrancar divided between their bodies and their swords into two bodies. When we once again become one, our power is released.” – Coyote Starrk
“Sorry about this. To be honest, it’s a pain for me too.” – Coyote Starrk
“I said I’m not the type, didn’t I? I give up. Aizen-sama doesn’t have any intention of helping us. Those guys are strong. I get it, I’m done. Even if we keep fighting like this, somebody else is probably gonna die. I get it, so let’s go home and get some sleep.” – Coyote Sarrk#“You are a Shinigami and I am a Hollow! Whichever side loses will be annihilated. That’s how it’s always been for thousands of years. Do you need any other reason to fight? Come on. The one who remains standing will return alive. That’s all it comes down to!” – Grimmjow
“Whether you’re a Human, or a Shinigami or an Arrancar, anyone who looks at me like they’re underestimating my power, I’ll smash every one of ’em into oblivion!” – Grimmjow
“I threw it away before I got here, ’cause I won’t need two arms to kill you.” – Grimmjow
“You underestimating me, Shinigami? I still don’t quite feel like killing you, yet. Get a grip and come on! Show me your Bankai. If you don’t, I’ll do the same thing I did to that little Shinigami over there and put a freakin’ hole in you!” – Grimmjow
“They’re all cowards, every damn one of them. Whatever. I’ll just consume them. As they become my flesh and blood, they will see beyond. I… I am the king!” – Grimmjow
“It’s best to crush insects quickly once they’ve gotten inside, right?” – Grimmjow

“Shut the hell up. Enough with the screamin’ kid. Next time you make a fuss, I’m gonna blast you into next week!” – Grimmjow

“Like I’d lose… like I’d… there’s no way… no way I’d lose to someone like you!” – Grimmjow“If I’m not partnering with a good cooking man, then what’s the point in partnering at all?” – Ichika Amasawa
“I kept it a secret for now out of goodwill…But, I wonder if I shall reveal it?” – Ichika Amasawa
“I won’t be convinced with just words alone~ I’ll have to make sure of it with my own eyes.” – Ichika Amasawa
“You want me to help you out again, huh? And on the uninhabited island? Are you thinking ’bout doing something vulgar?” – Ichika Amasawa
“I’ll say it again. Ayanokōji-senpai is a very special person to me. I’ll never allow him to get expelled by an outsider like you.” – Ichika Amasawa
“It’s alright. I can predict all the ways he will try to reject me.” – Ichika Amasawa
“I’d rather you not come to such a vulgar conclusion~. It’s not that I ‘like’ him romantically or anything, it’s more that I ‘love’ him…? No, I suppose it’s much, much more than that… A feeling that goes far beyond the likes of love.” – Ichika Amasawa
“How ‘bout you try and make Sudō-senpai into a cooking pro now? I wonder if you’ll have time for that though. I’m a popular girl, so like, if you’re too slow I might settle on a partner already.” – Ichika Amasawa
“Other than strong guys, I guess I like a guy who can cook, how’s that?” – Ichika Amasawa
“Ah, are you finally admitting it? Well, it’s not like I don’t understand your feelings of wanting to hide it, but I know about it already, so there’s no need to lie to me, OK?” – Ichika Amasawa“Inside my heart there was another me who was squealing while running around. There’s no more mistaking it. I just have to admit it now. Seriously, seriously, seriously, my heart’s seriously been stolen away. The arrow which had pierced my heart. The arrow of love which I could no longer take out. Is this even possible? Is it even fine for me to fall in love with someone who’s been partly bullying me? But it’s already too late. The power of this arrow is tremendous. I have, I have towards Kiyotaka—–really, seriously, I’ve fallen in love with him.” – Kei Karuizawa
“Despite being betrayed, I didn’t betray in turn and that it meant he would be safe. If I could help him gain the peace he desires, then that’s not so bad.” – Kei Karuizawa
“Yup, as I thought you are the best… I’m never giving you up to another girl.” – Kei Karuizawa
“As I went over the memory again and again, I realized something. “Wait. He touched me, didn’t he? He put his hands on me.” It hadn’t really sunk in back then, but that’d happened, hadn’t it? He touched my thighs. I’d never even held hands with a boy before. What in the world had he done to me?” – Kei Karuizawa
“It’s just… I don’t really like bringing up my past. I thought I’d never tell anyone about it. But I ended up telling you, and it felt so surprisingly fine that it’s kind of odd.” – Kei Karuizawa
“Well, whatever. It’s not like this is the first time someone’s used force against me. After a while, I gave up trying to resist. That’s right; I was everyone’s victim. I became cold, robotic. I could cry, scream, or thrash around, but it didn’t matter. So, why aren’t you laughing? Why don’t you laugh at the pitiful loser who’s been bullied all her life?” – Kei Karuizawa
“I’m grateful to the people who bullied me, and the school that covered it up, No one here knows about my past. That’s why I was able to become a new me.” – Kei Karuizawa
“Looking back right now, this was the first time Ayanokouji-kun and me spend time alone together. In my three years of school life, he would become the most important and irreplaceable person, but at this very moment I wasn’t aware of it.” – Kei Karuizawa
“Ah is that so? I can’t understand since I no longer have anything to fear anymore.” – Kei Karuizawa
“I know everything about myself, including my strengths and weaknesses. I know that none of the boys or girls like me. Even knowing that, I’ve never thought to change. But it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t hurt me anymore. Because for some reason, I want them to feel that way.” – Kei Karuizawa
“God is cruel. My life was destroyed because of that nightmarish day. I lost my youth, my friends, and even myself. I have to fix that mistake. No matter how much people hate me, it’ll be better than suffering like that again. The most important thing is protecting myself.” – Kei Karuizawa
“I thought you were really amazing yesterday. You got a bit of my respect, seeing you take the initiative for the class. But Kiyotaka is a different matter altogether. If you are that scared, your relationship with him will never begin.” – Kei Karuizawa
“In the end, nothing changed even after I came to this school. No, that’s wrong… Maybe I never had any intention of changing. For better or worse, it’s always been the same for me. After all, I understand myself better than anyone else.” – Kei Karuizawa
“This is fine. I’m fine with this. I repeatedly told myself that. I will break here though. But for some reason, I felt a little proud of myself. That despite being betrayed, I didn’t betray in turn and that it meant he would be safe. If I could help him gain the peace he desires, then that’s not so bad. That’s that then. Somehow, aren’t I cool? There never was anything interesting going on with my life but by cooperating with Kiyotaka, things got exciting and that’s not so bad. I had fun. How should I put it, almost like the heroine supporting her hero from the shadows? Although I didn’t understand a lot of what he did, it was still somehow strangely fun. Besides, no matter how it happened, it’s still a fact that I was saved. That’s why I regret nothing. I have no regrets. But, you know? The truth is, deep down inside, I still held out hope that he might come and save me.” – Kei Karuizawa“Hard work is worthless for those that don’t believe in themselves.” – Naruto Uzumaki
“Because they saved me from myself, they rescued me from my loneliness. They were the first to accept me for who I am. They’re my friends.” – Naruto Uzumaki

“Sasuke, I always knew you were alone. In the beginning I was glad because I thought you were like me – I wanted to talk to you! But you… didn’t speak. You always had everyone watching you. You could do everything and we were too different. So I decided that you would become my rival. I didn’t want to lose because I was called a loser all the time. Even when we became Team 7, I still thought this way. I always tried to lie but… but the truth is… I always wanted to be like you. I aspired to be like you. Because of that… I was glad that you wanted to fight me.” – Naruto Uzumaki

“I’m here purely by coincidence.” – Arisu Sakayanagi
“Someone in Class D saw through your plans and defeated you. Is that all there is to it? This school is fundamentally designed to pit classes against each other. You and I have clashed numerous times in this manner. I don’t know who this Class D student is, but they’re employing excellent strategy by remaining anonymous while waging war on you. Are you really going to expend all this energy on interrogating an unrelated student? Honestly, I can’t see your actions as anything but rather pathetic.” – Arisu Sakayanagi
“Its been quite a long time, Ayanokōji-kun. It’s been eight years and 243 days actually.” – Arisu Sakayanagi
“This is a fascinating conversation. Someone in Class D is getting in Class C’s way, are they? I heard rumors that Dragon Boy-san was searching for such a person, but is that really true?” – Arisu Sakayanagi
“To lead a school life that’s interesting… And protect my beloved person from unwanted vermin I suppose.” – Arisu Sakayanagi
“Oh, it’s quite all right that you don’t know me. But I know you. We have a strange sort of bond, you could say. To reunite with you in a place like this… To be honest, I never thought I’d see you again. But now, all the mysteries have been cleared away. The island, the cruise ship, and Class D’s expulsion uproar. I couldn’t imagine that everything was on account of Horikita Suzune. So you were pulling the strings.” – Arisu Sakayanagi“Only answer with “Yes” or “Woof”, I don’t need a dog who says “No”. – Makima

“I don’t need to be at peace. I don’t care if I have to bloody my hands. Even if it means living a life that could end at any moment… Even if it means having to leave the Forger family… I think Loid would respect that. He would understand. That’s why I won’t give up this fight!” – Yor Forger

“People… humans are the being who look for happiness. What the Britannian boy, Lelouch, wanted to have was nothing but a small happiness. It’s nothing special. At least at the root of his motives, there were only humble wishes that were simply natural to any human. Who could ever disclaim such dreams and such vows? Who could ever have the right to do that? However, whoever you might be, without choice, you have to deal with others and with the world, and have yourself be regulated and set down. Therefore, in the face of the world’s wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they can’t help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and judgment. What stands in front of Lelouch is the past he brought forth by himself. Is it a hatred resulting from the fact that humans are humans? Nonetheless, for now, we should be grateful… Yes, at least, to the fact that humans are the beings who look for happiness.” – C.C
“Why don’t you understand? Nunnally was blinded! My own sister was crippled! She knew… she knew that there were things in this world that she will never be able to do by herself! So her smile… Nunnally’s smile… was her way of expressing gratitude!” – Lelouch Lamperouge

“I assure you, my gratitude is sincere.” – Uryuu Ishida
“Being thrown away by humans, devoted to them even though you aren’t one of them… and once they are finished with you, they have you end your life yourself… and not even an ounce of gratitude for all that. On the contrary: for your whole life you are hated and reviled. It really is idiotic. We are a different species after all. Once you start seeing things that way, it all becomes very easy to accept. Do humans shed tears for the birds, pigs, cows and sheep that become their food? Of course they don’t. They are a different species after all. That is nature. That is the truth. That is Providence. Your way of thinking up to now was the warped one.” – Ritful
“Life is short so it will be appreciated. We live to our fullest due to that.” – Hattori Heiji
“There are all sorts of goodbyes. There are sad goodbyes, and sometimes goodbyes you’re thankful for, that take a load off your mind. It often happens that someone you say goodbye to unexpectedly returns, all self-conscious. Then there are times when, anticipating that, you put on the front of a short goodbye, only to have them not return so soon. And then there are goodbyes that last forever, true goodbyes that only happen once in your life.” – Yasaburo Shimogamo
“Right now, we’re all really only taking it day by day. Even if we can’t get used to things, even if we can’t win at something, even if we don’t have any excess…In order to live day by day, we work, we fail, and we succeed. Sometimes we laugh. For the blessing before our very eyes, for our friends, we’re thankful. Who knew that people could feel happiness just from living?” – Sei“The beginning is upon us. I suggest you prepare. We’re drawing close to a new world in which only true pirates can survive. The weak should run while they still can or be swept away by the tides of time. As they role back to reveal a new era of champions.” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“That’s ridiculous. People usually have a stereotypical idea, or an assumption like that and that’s what creates a blind spot.” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“Who’s going to be happy seeing you safe and sound after running around like a coward? If you can’t cut down your foe, take a blow and bleed for yourself! Every human being… even the most pious saint, harbors a latent streak of barbarity that surfaces when he sees blood!” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“That’s right! Whatever the tragedy or the blunder is, only the things that actually happened are written in stone!” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“The time is almost here. Go and lay the groundwork. A world where only true pirates can survive will soon be upon us. Those without power, flee while you can. The tide will bring those of unmatched power and the New Era will begin!” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“The fact that you miserable brats thought, for even an instant, that you could actually beat me is the highest disgrace! Understand this. I am of the noblest blood in the world… a Celestial Dragon! I possessed the rarest of powers. Nobility by birth! However! One day my father decided that our family of four should give up the greatest power there is and come live in this cesspool of a world! Live like a human, indeed. What a stupid, stupid man! And what do you think happened? I witnessed both heaven and hell by the age of ten. So I killed my father, the root of my suffering… and took his head to Mariejois! But the Celestial Dragons in heaven would not take back anyone from the line of traitors. There was no escape from this hell. And that’s when I swore that I would destroy everything they hold dear about the world they control! The lives you’ve led cannot compare to what I’ve been through! I don’t have time to waste with you miserable brats!” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“The weaker person is the more he gets hung up on other people’s pain and then he self-destructs.” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous? These terms have always changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand at the top determine what’s wrong and what’s right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice!” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“There is a difference in the look of the ordinary vagabond and that of a determined man.” – Donquixote Doflamingo
“I lost my mother when I was 8…and killed my father when I was 10. Those with the title of “Executive” or above…are my “family”, with whom I’ve shared my joys and sorrows. They’re the only thing I have! I won’t forgive anyone that laughs at my family. Understood?” – Donquixote Doflamingo“What are you doing? Why do you run Ichigo? You still have not called me. Face forward, Ichigo. You should be able to hear it now. That which blocks your ears is worthless fear. The enemy is one, you are one. What is there to fear? Cast off your fear. Look forward! Go forward! Never stand still. Retreat and you will age. Hesitate and you will die. Shout… my name is… ZANGETSU!” – Zangetsu
“Though you fight a fierce battle on the outside, your inner world trembles not the slightest.” – Zangetsu
“I see. So I still haven’t reached you…” – Zangetsu
“Ichigo, I don’t know if you understand or not,… but, Zangetsu and I have always been one and the same. Both Zangetsu and I are a part of your spiritual power, and I was apart of Zangetsu! We all share the same body, and whenever the ‘dominant’ person changes, the outer appearance also changes. When one is dominated by ‘life’, one is flesh. When one is dominated by ‘death’, one becomes bones. It’s the same reasoning. My power expanded, and so the ruling power went to me. And this way, Zangetsu became a part of me instead. The more you try to use Zangetsu’s power, the easier it is for me to control your soul!” – Zangetsu
“I refuse to carry a king who’s weaker than me and get cut to ribbons with him. If you’re weaker than me, then I’ll destroy you, and take your crown for myself.” – Zangetsu
“Abandon your fear. Look forward. Move forward and never stop. You’ll age if you pull back. You’ll die if you hesitate.” – Zangetsu
“To fight…Or to live…Choose.” – Zangetsu
“Ichigo, what’s the difference between a king and his horse? I don’t mean kiddy shit like “One’s a person and one’s an animal” or “One has two legs and one has four.” If their form, ability and power were exactly the same, why is it that one becomes the king and controls the battle, while the other becomes the horse and carries the king?! There’s only one answer. Instinct! In order for identical beings to get stronger and gain the power they need to become king, they must search for more battles and power! They thirst for battle, and live to mercilessly, crush, shred, and slice their enemies! Deep, deep within our body lies the honed instinct to kill, and slaughter our enemies! But you don’t have that! You don’t have those pure, base instincts! You fight with your brain. You try to defeat your enemies with logic! And it doesn’t work! You’re trying to cut them with a sheathed sword! That’s why you’re weaker than me, Ichigo!” – Zangetsu
“Who am I? How can you ask such a stupid question? I am who I am!” – Zangetsu
“He’s strong… Zangetsu… train him well… because one day, that power will become all mine.” – Zangetsu
“Just how many times must I strain my voice before it will reach you? And yet, nowhere in this world can there be anyone who knows me better than you.” – Zangetsu
“Ichigo… I hate the rain. Rain falls in this world, too. When your heart is in chaos, this sky becomes clouded. When you are sad, rain falls so terribly easy. Can you understand…the horrible feeling of being pelted by rain when you’re all alone in this solitary world? If only to stop that rain, I shall lend you any strength. If you trust in me, I won’t let a single drop of rain fall from that sky. Ichigo, trust me…you are not fighting alone.” – Zangetsu“Being strong isn’t just about having power or move, it about one’s spirit.” – Roronoa Zoro
“If I can’t even protect my captain’s dream, then whatever ambition I have is nothing but talk…” – Roronoa Zoro
“A wound that’d make an ordinary man unconscious… I won’t lose to it. A wound that would kill an ordinary person… I won’t lose to it! To face one who is extraordinary, Hawk Eyes… I can’t allow myself to be ordinary!” – Roronoa Zoro
“You’ll never understand…your swords will never be as heavy as mine!” – Roronoa Zoro

“There should be a limit to how similar a couple looks like.” – Roronoa Zoro
“I’m going to be the world’s greatest swordsman! All I have left is my destiny! My name may be infamous…but it’s gonna shake the world!!!” – Roronoa Zoro

“You sure can talk the talk, but you’re not quite ready to walk the walk. Time’s up, it’s my turn.” – Roronoa Zoro
“I do things my own way! So don’t give me any lip about it!” – Roronoa Zoro
“I don’t know. I’m not sure why myself. But if I were to take even one step back, I believe that all those important oaths, promises and many other deals ’til now, will all go to waste and I’ll never be able to return before you, ever again.” – Roronoa Zoro
“If you do anything that would cause me to abandon my ambitions… You will end your own life on my sword!” – Roronoa Zoro
“I’m a pirate hunter.” – Roronoa Zoro
“I don’t care what the society says. I’ve regretted doing anything. I will survive and do what I want to.” – Roronoa Zoro
“You’ve underestimated me, snow woman. When you thought you couldn’t beat me, you should have run. Of course, there are things that I don’t wanna cut. But… let me ask you something. Have you ever seen a fierce animal you were sure would never bite? Because I haven’t.” – Roronoa Zoro
“If you kill yourself, I’ll kill you.” – Roronoa Zoro
“If I die here, then I’m a man that could only make it this far.” – Roronoa Zoro

“Either in belief or doubt, if I lean to one of these sides, my reaction time will be dulled if my heart thinks the opposite of what I choose.” – Roronoa Zoro
“When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It’s not like somebody’s gonna save you if you start babbling excuses.” – Roronoa Zoro
“When you decided to go to the sea, it was your own decision. Whatever happens to you on the sea, it depends on what you’ve done! Don’t blame others!” – Roronoa Zoro
“When I decided to follow my dream, I had already discarded my life.” – Roronoa Zoro
“There is someone that I must meet again. And until that day…not even Death itself can take my life away!” – Roronoa Zoro“The fight to protect life and the fight to protect honor——that’s Captain Ukitake’s policy. But you know, Kuchiki…I think that in the end, those both end up being the same thing. …Heart.” – Shiba Kaien

“Remember that as long as you’re in my division, I will stand by you even if I die.” – Shiba Kaien
“Don’t forget… as long as you’re in my division, I’m on your side until death and beyond.” – Shiba Kaien
“Every time you and I connect with each other, a little bit of heart is born between us. Heart isn’t something inside you. But whenever you think, whenever you remember someone, that’s when heart is born. If you were the only one alive in the whole world, heart wouldn’t exist now, would it?” – Shiba Kaien
“Whenever you fight from this point on, there is one thing that you must never do. And that is to die alone. Our bodies are composed entirely from Reishi. If we die, our bodies will disintegrate and become part of the reishi that makes up Soul Society. And when that time comes, where will your heart go? Your heart will be passed on to your friends. If you pass it on to your friends, then your heart will always live on within them. Kuchiki, that’s why you must never, ever, ever die alone.” – Shba Kaien
“When we die, our bodies disintegrate and become part of the reishi that make up Soul Society. And when that time comes…where does your heart go? It gets passed on to your nakama (comrades). If you pass it on to them, then your heart will always live on within them.” – Shiba Kaien
“Because our captain is weak and sick, I’m usually in charge of everything! Therefore you may call me “Captain” Kaien if you like!” – Shiba Kaien“This world is merciless, and it’s also very beautiful.” – Mikasa Ackerman
“I don’t want to lose what little family I have left.” – Mikasa Ackerman
“There are only so many lives I can value. And I decided who those people were six years ago. So you shouldn’t try to ask for my pity. Because right now, I don’t have time to spare or room in my heart.” – Mikasa Ackerman
“That’s right… This world… is cruel. It hit me that living was like a miracle.” – Mikasa Ackerman
“I’m sorry Eren. I won’t give up. I’ll never give up again. So I’ll win, no matter what! I’ll survive no matter what.” – Mikasa Ackerman

“You don’t stand a single chance to win unless you fight.” – Mikasa Ackerman“People are crazy for believing that these walls will protect us forever. Even though the walls have been intact for the past 100 years, there’s nothing that can guarantee they won’t be broken down today.” – Armin Arlert

“I don’t like the terms good person or bad person because it’s impossible to be entirely good to everyone, or entirely bad to everyone. To some, you are a good person, while to others you are a bad person.” – Armin Arlert
“The strong feed upon the weak. It’s such an obligingly simple rule. Except in this world, my friends tried to be strong.” – Armin Arlert
“Endure it. Don’t let go.” – Armin Arlert
“Everyone can make a choice after they have learned what it will result in. It is so easy to say we should have done it this way afterwards. But you can’t know what your choice will result in before actually choosing.” – Armin Arlert
“I was, I am, and I remain a soldier, sworn to devote my heart and soul to the restoration of humankind. There is no greater glory than dying for that belief!” – Armin Arlert
“I’d rather die than become a burden.” – Armin Arlert“Wow. That must’ve been awful. Do you want to hear how I came here? Both of my parents abused me. One day, they got sick of me and threw me out of a moving car. I was brought here.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“I don’t care about the glory. You can have it.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“In the end, the best way to live down here is to be smart. You’ve got to be clever to survive.” Mikaela Hyakuya
“If my only other choice is being a vampire, then yes! I’d rather be dead!” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“The vampires don’t really care about humanity in general. It’s only specific humans like you that concern them… The kind of humans who will stop at nothing to acquire more power.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“The humans… No, the people who ran our orphanage were using me and Yu as guinea pigs in their experiments. That’s what you told me. You said they were horrible experiments that would destroy the world, so you came in and saved us. Right? But according to the Council, you were supposed to kill us. So why let us live? It jeopardizes your position. What in the world do you want with us?” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“What if one day just the Hyakuya Orphanage family got out? What if we found a world with no vampires in it at all? Wouldn’t that be great?” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“I will do whatever it takes to protect you. And to keep you out of the hands of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army. They’ve used people like us for years, Yu. Used us in their experiments. I’m sure that Guren person didn’t save you and take you in out of the goodness of his heart. We’re part of the Seraph of the End Project.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“All the other humans chose death. But you didn’t. Instead, you played dead to save your own pathetic life. That’s already a betrayal of our comrades. In the end, you just don’t want to die, right? Filthy, shameless human. If you really want to live that bad, talk. Sell out your companions for real. Where are the rest of the humans who attacked this place?” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“Shut up, Human. I didn’t do this for you. How dare you use him like this!” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“When humans dare to break a certain taboo and try to do what is forbidden, then an angel of destruction is supposed to appear. That’s what the vampires say anyway. But humans are greedy. They’ll break taboo without a second thought. That’s why the vampires went around the world, crushing any organization that tinkered with that forbidden experiment.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“They always think they have good reasons, Yu. Hell, even serial killers convince themselves they have good reasons for murdering people!” – Mikaela Hyakuya“A lot of the time, you’re going into a situation you know nothing about. So what you need is to be quick to act… and make tough decisions in worst-case scenarios.” – Levi Ackerman
“I don’t know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that… No matter what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it’s right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice.” – Levi Ackerman

“I don’t have time to worry if it’s right or wrong, you can’t hope for a horror story with a happy ending.” – Eren Jaeger

“I disposed of some dangerous beasts. Mere animals that just happened to resemble humans.” – Eren Jaeger“I will announce the goal for everyone to turn Ainz Ooal Gown into an eternal legend. If there are many heroes, then we will replace them all. Let the entire world know that Ainz Ooal Gown is the true hero!” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Death by sword. Death by broken bones. Death by crushing. There’s not much difference, right? You die at the end.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“It looks like you’re too weak to even play around with.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Calm down, Albedo. The personalities of you NPCs were created by my old comrades. All your good and bad qualities were created with their hearts. I love all of you because of that. ” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I know your strength and trust you, Albedo. However, until we know more about this world, we must always move forward believing the enemy is stronger than us.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Today is the last day Yggdrasil’s servers will run. Why not stay until the end?” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I hope we meet again somewhere, huh? Just when and where would that be?” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“It’s fine. Everyone makes mistakes. You just need to make an effort not to make the same mistake again.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“In the past, there was no one who did not know this name.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“There was no need for me to fight someone of your level seriously. In other words, you weren’t even an enemy worthy of using magic on.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Ainz Ooal Gown does not know defeat.’ Know this. The strength of the 41 people from Ainz Ooal Gown stands before you! And you did not have any chance of winning from the start! Shalltear Bloodfallen. I am the leader of the supreme beings of the Tomb of Nazarick. Feel the power of the man you all respect and call your master!” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Don’t say stupid things! How many times do I have to tell you the reason why we’re here?” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I could revive the dead villagers with this Wand of Resurrection. But, a magic caster who brings death and a magic caster who can revive the dead. It’s not hard to imagine which one would be dragged into more trouble. Unless that situation changes, you’ll just have to be satisfied that I saved the village.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“If she betrayed us because she is dissatisfied with me or our treatment of her, I can understand.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I’ll tell everyone here and now. I am the one at fault. I didn’t think of the possibility, though we had gathered so much information. Shalltear, you are not guilty of anything. Remember this well.” – Ainz Ooal Gown“If what I wished for was granted to me, if what I wanted was given to me. Then, as I thought, I wouldn’t wish for anything nor want anything. Because the things you were granted and the things you were given were surely shams that would one day be lost. The things you wished for had no shape and the things you wanted were untouchable. Or possibly, they might be the most wonderful treasures that would become nothing if you were to touch them.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“If wishes could be granted, if desires could be fulfilled, then I wouldn’t wish or desire for anything after all. The things you’re handed on a silver platter are never genuine, and never everlasting. And that is why I’ll always keep searching.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I want to reply with a long message, but if it’s too long, that might be kind of revolting. But if it’s too short, then I might come off as cold instead. Feeling apprehensive of what to do, I decided to reply back with a similar word count instead. This was what they called “mirroring” in psychology. By emulating the actions of the other party, your affection levels would increase!” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Yeah, I’m being stupid. I know that it’s out of question. I know how this will end. I’ll be left with nothing. Even so, I want us to think, writhe, struggle… and find… something genuine.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Well it’s not like the world is full of sunshine and daisies. If society was only shaped by the view that one must be happy-go-lucky all the time, Hollywood wouldn’t make tear-jerking movies, would they?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“A lone warrior surviving hundreds of battles, when it comes to losing, I’m the strongest.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Youth is both a lie and a form of evil.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Really, what a joke. I just didn’t understand what these nice guys were thinking about. Because they were so in love with everyone getting along, they ended up opening up other problems when they try to fix one. I didn’t even ask to be thrown into that circle either.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I’m not highly aware. I’m highly self-aware.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are no inherently bad people. Everyone believes that, myself included. I don’t doubt the existence of virtue. And yet people bare their fangs when it seems they can profit. People will rationalize their own behavior whenever they become tainted with evil; they’re not supposed to be evil. In order to preserve their own twisted integrity, the world becomes twisted. Someone you praised as “cool” until yesterday is “stuck up” today; someone you respected as “smart and knowledgeable” is now scorned as someone who “looks down on bad students”, and “energetic vigor” becomes “annoying and overly carried away”.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“It doesn’t matter if we’re wrong…because every time we go wrong, we’ll continue to look for the right answer.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“It is better to be hated for what you are, than to be loved for what you are not.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Do you know the phrase “enough specks of dust creates a mountain”? Or maybe “three heads are better than one.” In other words, when people gather together, they become even stronger and more secure. However, we were a group of failures who had gathered to do pointless things.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Everyone is a slave to their past. No matter how much you wish to move forward, the events of last year will bear down on you like the light of the stars as soon as you glance up. Unable to laugh or to banish your past, you carry it ceaselessly in a corner of your heart, waiting for it to resurrect at an inopportune moment.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“The Devil’s finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There was no meaning to things that were only superficial. That was a single belief that both me and her once shared.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“When people reach the halfway mark of a long ordeal, how do they feel? Does being only halfway there make them despair? Or do they feel relief at making it halfway there? Most people have to feel one way or the other, and both emotions create an opening in their hearts. That’s why I pushed myself this far.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“As they say about the vulgar masses, the more people flock to a group, the more foolish they become. No matter how prominent an individual is, no, it’s because he is prominent that he would be blotted out by the sheer force of numbers when thrown into that lump of people. Individual will, qualifications, and personality, let alone emotions aren’t considered at all. We see only what we want to see, listen only to what we want to listen to, but for the things we want to say, we aren’t able to. This is the society that we’re living in right now.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“You can’t take back the answer you already gave out. There’s no use in crying over spilt milk. The egg you broke won’t come back. All the horses and soldiers of a king will never return to his side again. It doesn’t matter what was said. You can never wipe away a bad impression. Even though the opposite is so simple in comparison. Just one word will make someone appear hateful. Just doing one thing would make you seem hateful. That’s why excuses are meaningless. Because even those excuses will make you look hateful.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Expecting others to read your mind is delusional.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“It’s arrogant to think just saying things out loud is enough. Self-gratifying on the part of the speaker, and conceited on the part of the listener. You won’t always come to an understanding by talking things out.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are people who ruin the atmosphere just by existing, you know.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“We all have our own personal image that’s dictated by others, one that’s always off the mark. We wish to remain true to ourselves, but who gets to decide who we are as people? When our image never goes hand-in-hand with reality, where can we find something genuine? Where can we find our true selves?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“So long as a problem doesn’t cause problems, it can’t be called a problem.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“What if, and this is strictly hypothetical, what if you could reload your save data to change your previous choice, like in a game? Would it change your life? The answer is a resounding no.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are people who can’t act unless they’re faced with a problem. Unless they find their reason. All I was left with was the sinking suspicion that I’d gone horribly wrong.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Don’t put me on their level. I don’t care about looking interesting. I’m just self-conscious.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“That’s not exactly right. If you had to sacrifice many things to protect one, you’re more likely to give up and throw it away. Including relationships you have in your hand now.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are some people who don’t want a solution. Some want things to stay the way they are. There’s no way to make things convenient for everyone. So the only option is to find a compromise.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Having people acknowledge your existence is a wonderful thing.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“When a girl calls someone a “nice guy”, it means she couldn’t care less about him.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I’m always alone. Other people don’t factor into what I do. The things that happen in front of me are parts of my life and my life alone.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“If there are things you learn with friends, there must also be things you learn without friends. They must be of equal worth, two sides of the same coin.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Damn. My eyes are naturally drawn in her direction. Is this the unibreastal law of gravitation? Leave it to Sir Isaac Newtit.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“A wandering soul in isolation, has no need for a place to belong.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Relying on someone, helping each other out, and supporting each other. Most would say that’s the right thing to do. However, that’s just idealistic. In reality, someone always gets the short end of the stick.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“What does someone who´s lost their standing want the most? That’s simple. They want someone to find them, where they’re standing.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Excuses are meaningless. The tougher things get, the more likely people are to come to their own conclusions.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There is a history to humans. Humans are shaped by the experience obtained from living as time continued to wind and wind. To be reborn meant being rid of that history; complete annihilation. However, that just wasn’t possible in reality. That’s why the only thing you could do was to continue living on, bearing the scars on your body and holding the weight of the sins on your back, without wishing for reincarnation.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“They say that if you change yourself, you’ll change the world. but that’s a complete lie. They’re just forcing you to compromise, by feeding you a convenient little fib.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I’m super thoughtful. That’s why I stay in the corner and don’t cause anyone trouble.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“What the hell is with everyone telling me to change? I don’t want other people telling me who I am.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I don’t believe in crap like coincidence, fate, or destiny.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“School trips are simply a simulation of adult social life. If you ever go on a business trip with your boss, you won’t get to choose where to stay or what to eat, but if you compromise, you can still have a modicum of fun. School trips train you to trick yourself into that kinda mindset.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Everyone has something they hold dear, something they never want to lose. That’s why they pretend. That’s why they hide the truth. And that’s why they lie.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Food tastes best when you don’t have to work for it.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Marriage, the institution where one’s existence goes to die. All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying “I’m home!” to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say “I’m home!” if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say “I’m home!” to the hippos on the label. And if they’re talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they’re working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“The past makes you wanna die out of regret and future makes you depressed out of anxiety. So by elimination, the present is likely the happiest time.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“One ought to experience loneliness at least once or twice in life. No, you have to experience it. The idea of being chained to another person without reprieve is far more abnormal and disquieting. One has no choice but to learn about loneliness. I’m sure some things can’t be experienced without it.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“About marriage or about future, I don’t know what will happen in the future. In this world, it’s normal that when there’s a preparation, then a new grief is born, but everyone has the right to desire happiness. Our efforts need to be held for the sake of our future.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Working hard alone doesn’t assure you that you’ll achieve your dreams. Actually there are more cases where you don’t. Even so, working hard and achieving something is some consolation at least.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I like myself. I have never once hated myself. My high specs, my half-decent looks, my pessimistic, realist point of view… I don’t hate any of it at all.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I’ve forged my own way alone. While you were consoling and fighting with one another, I faced everything myself, head on. Now look at how strong I am.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“When humans are faced with truly terrifying circumstances, they don’t think about other people around them. They’re even willing to sacrifice those around themselves. By exposing that unsightly part of them, they can no longer get along.” – Hachiman Hiigaya
“You can’t run away” is an ideal for the strong. You’re not always wrong. Society, the world, the people around you – often someone else is in the wrong. To think that you can change is adapting to this cruel, indifferent, trashy world. It’s admitting defeat and servility. You’re simply deceiving yourself by dressing it up with pretty words.” – Hachman Hikigaya
“Isn’t changing yourself the same as running away? Why can’t you just accept who you are?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“People who grow up in different environments will invariably have different tastes and preferences. Therefore, could one say that the subsequent marriages necessarily lead to happiness?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“If the truth is a cruel mistress, then a lie must be a nice girl.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Now that just looks horrible. It’s like some feudal society. If that’s what it takes to make friends in this world, forever alone is fine by me.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Is it wrong to do stuff by yourself? If someone worked hard on their own until now, why do they have to face rejection here?” – Hachiman Hikigaya“We are NOT asking him where the treasure is hidden!!! We’re not even asking him whether there IS any treasure or not!! I’m not sure, but… …everybody set out to sea, risking their lives to search for it!!! If you ask this old man anything about it here and now… Then I’ll quit being a pirate! I don’t want to go on a boring adventure like that!” – Monkey D Luffy

“An island from a dream within a dream? I could never pass up a great adventure like this!” – Monkey D Luffy
“Being alone hurts worse than pain.” – Monkey D Luffy
“Hero? No! We’re pirates! I love heroes, but I don’t wanna be one! Do you know what heroes are? Say there is a chunk of meat. Pirates will have a banquet and eat it, but heroes will share it with other people. I want all the meat!” – Monkey D Luffy
“Are we friends? Or are we foes? That kind of thing you decide for yourselves!” – Monkey D Luffy
“Forgetting is like a wound. The wound may heal but it has already left a scar.” – Monkey D Luffy

“Power isn’t determined by your size, but the size of your heart and dreams!” – Monkey D Luffy
“Dying is not repaying a debt! That is not what he saved you for. Only weak men would die after someone spared their lives!” – Monkey D Luffy“I am a Saiyan who was raised on Planet Earth… and in the name of every single Saiyan that you’ve made suffer… for them and all the people of Planet Namek too, I will defeat you!” – Goku

“That’s enough! Even if it is true and I’m some kind of alien from another planet, or even if you really are my older brother, it doesn’t matter, anyone who’d do the horrible things you say is no brother of mine! My name is Goku, and this is my home… and you’re not welcome here!” – Goku

“So long as I don’t give up, the possibility of winning will never fall to zero.” – Tetsuya Kuroko
“Winning is everything in this world. The victors write history. The losers are wiped from it.” – Seijuro Akashi
“When I tell you to leave, leave. In this world, winning is everything. Winners are affirmed completely, and losers are denied completely. I’ve never lost at anything before, and I never will. Because I always win, and I’m always right. I show no mercy to those who oppose me, not even my own parents.” – Seijuro Akashi
“It’s not about doing what it takes to win. Sei-chan told me before “Winning is just like breathing”. Victory isn’t something that Sei-chan seeks. It’s a natural part of his life. It’s a basic bodily function.” – Reo Mibuchi
“The pain of getting hit, the frustration of loosing, the joy of winning, all of that. They’ve been driven into this body, fists, and this head. It becomes my strength in the next fight. All of my battles up to now, those memories, they are all of my power.” – Gray Fullbuster
“God, just how long are they going to squabble over such pointless things? They are all the same in my eyes. Nothing but a bunch of trash. Light and Darkness. Good and Evil. Poison and Antidote. Winning and Losing. Strength and Weakness. Black and White. Success and Failure. Happiness or Sorrow… They’re all the same after all. Why hasn’t everyone realized this already.” – Najimi Ajimu
“Exams are an opportunity to teach correctly the meaning of winning and losing, of strong and weak. Students soak up heaping helpings of successes and setbacks! Take in now what it means to win, what it means to lose!” – Koro Sensei
“I feel no responsibility to comrades who’ve lost lives under my command. Because they chose to fight in each battle.. Just as I chose this. But if there is something that… I can do for them. Something I can do for the dead… Then it is to win! I must keep winning to attain my dream. The same one they clung to, and risked their lives for!! To realize my dream, I will perch on top of their corpses.. It is a blood-smeared dream, after all. I don’t regret or feel guilty about it.. But to risk thousands of lives while never getting myself dirty. It’s not a dream that can be so easily realized!” – Griffith
“What’s the use of looking towards the past? If past data dictates reality… then our 33,1 winning percentage last year means we shouldn’t even be playing the Mariners and their 66,7 winning percentage.” – Toua Tokuchi
“Winning a game is not dependent on surpassing your opponents with your strength or waiting for lucky breaks. Conquer the opponent, crushing them, and stepping over the fallen ones ruthlessly. Winning means dominating over countless dead bodies.” – Toua Tokuchi
“I never thought about winning making me cool, or losing making me uncool. But you’re right. If anything… Giving up before you even try is kind of uncool. That’s why I want to be someone who’ll fight as many times as it takes, and never give up. That’s got to be way more cooler.” – Tachibana Hotaru
“I know no one expects much from me! And I know better than anyone how useless a C Class hero is! I know I’m too weak even for B Class! I know more than anyone else that I’ll never beat you! But I must fight you anyway! I’m the only one left! It’s not about winning or losing! I just have to stand here and face you!” – Mumen Rider
“Most of the winning results in war is caused by pursuit. Do you know why? Leaving aside modern times, it seems during the era of bayonet warfare, the worst losses always, arise from the moments when the losing side is being pursued.” – Sakamoto Yuuji
“All people are nothing but tools. It doesn’t matter how it’s done. It doesn’t matter what needs to be sacrificed. In this world, winning is everything. As long as I win in the end…That’s all that matters.” – Ayanokouji Kiyotaka

“What’s the probability of drawing the ace of spades from a deck with no jokers? Normaly it would be 1/50. But what if its a brand new deck? The position of cards in a new deck are typically identical, so that means if you take out the jokers and draw the card at the very bottom, it’s the ace of spades almost 100% of the time. Oh that’s right! I didn’t say a word about it being a new deck. Rather, you didn’t ask. Being in the “no” gives you the power to turn the probability of winning from 1.92% to 100%. The more knowledge of a party will be the inevitable victor.” – Sora
“You will not go in there with hopes of winning the tournament the first time you compete. To do so would be arrogant! And arrogance is for fools, not warriors! So you will enter the tournament with the sole purpose of improving your fighting skills.” – Master Roshi
“Strength isn’t just about winning. Even if my attempts are pathetic and comical, and even if I’m covered in the mud of my defeat, if I can keep fighting and look up at the sky as I lie on the ground, that alone is proof of true strength!” – Haruyuki Arita

“In life, unrelated to one’s social standing or class as determined by man, there are some people who, by nature, are keys that set the world in motion. They are the true elite, as dictated by the golden rule of the universe.” – Griffith
“In this world, some people born are like keys that move the world and exist having no connection to the social hierarchy established by man.” – Griffith
“Stake your lives on this fight! Our survival demands that we stake our lives on this fight! And to survive, is to be victorious!” – Griffith
“I’ll not… betray my dream. That is all.” – Griffith
“While many can pursue their dreams in solitude, other dreams are like great storms blowing hundreds, even thousands of dreams apart in their wake. Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long after they have been abandoned they still smolder deep in men’s hearts. Some see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.” – Griffith
“It is my perception, that a true friend never relies on another’s dream. A person with the potential to be my true friend, must be able to find his reason for life without my help. And, he would have to put his heart and soul into protecting his dream. He would never hesitate to fight for his dream, even against me. For me, a true friend is one who stands equal on those terms..” – Griffth
“Is he living his dreams in death? Or.. is death the end of dreams?” – Griffith
“A friend would not just follow another’s dream… a friend would find his own reason to live.” – Griffith

Something I can do for the dead… Then it is to win! I must keep winning to attain my dream. The same one they clung to, and risked their lives for!! To realize my dream, I will perch on top of their corpses.. It is a blood-smeared dream, after all. I don’t regret or feel guilty about it..

“There are no convenient miracles, and there is logic that should be inviolable.” – Kusaribe Hakaze
“People can say there is a balance, a logic that everything happens for a reason… But the truth is far less designed. No matter how hard you work, when you die, you die. Some spend their entire life trying to scratch their way to the top, and still die in poverty. While others are born into wealth without ever working at all. It’s a cruel and random world. And yet the chaos is all so beautiful.” – Dante
“Everything you’ve been taught is based on theories and logic. Soon, you’ll come to realize how pointless they are.” – Tomomi Masaoka
“People’s thoughts, wishes, hopes and desires… We live in a time where technology can read everything in your mind, and yet, this place teems with people who hate, lie, steal and try to harm others. If that’s not irrational, then what is it?” – Tomomi Masaoka
“Argument and logic are not always the right path to take. Honestly expressing emotions is important. You were the one who helped me realize that.” – Kent
“Logic is using the front part of the brain, that’s all. But you can’t make a film with logic. Or if you look at it differently, everybody can make a film with logic. But my way is to not use logic.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Love and the human mind can’t be analyzed with formulas. It’s not so unusual for love to make you forget the sense of care and respect for others. There’s no logic. It’s an uncontrollable urge. To tell you the truth, it’d be worrisome if you became like that. Your mind is keen, and your character is good. But passion has nothing to do with mind or character.” – Alex Cazellnu
“When receiving an illogical favor from others, one should do the same to return the illogical favor.” – Fontier Setter

“Loving a person isn’t about logic or reason.” – Yukari Hayasaka
“If I abandoned you, I would be released from this pain. I would live on. But before long, I would end up seeking you again, for all my actions are ultimately devoted to you and only you. All I want is to stay on target and walk straight ahead—ignoring the losses and opposition, and even the results. That’s all I can do. Some people might call it an obsession, others may deem it a miracle—but to me and many others, my driving rationale couldn’t be more obvious and natural. There are people who understand this and there are people who don’t, and I simply happen to belong to the first group. The only difference is whether they have noticed that they don’t need boxes to make their wishes come true, and what it means to fulfill a wish.” – Hoshino Kazuki
“Human beings aren’t known for remaining calm and rational.” – Inaho Kaizuka
“Embrace that feeling. Love’s never rational.” – Suzuura Natsuki
“Only a foolish human would attempt to rationalize emotion.” – Yuuta Murakami
“Fear is proof that your imagination is functioning. Frankly, I feel bad for anyone who can’t feel fear. Without imagination, you can never deduce which action to take next.” – Kyoko Kirigiri
“How did you learn of the reality that you speak of? The entire world is governed by the reasoning of dirty-minded adults. We’re able to obscure reality according to our obsessions. We’re never actually shown what reality is. In this case, the reality that you speak of is a half-baked nonsense that has been altered. Trying to conform this bullshit reality into the one you want is like trying to join two pieces of a puzzle that do not fit.” – Franken Stein

“Hamlets mistake is that he believed in something like a ghost, that doesn’t exist. The second he believed in something irrational, he was doomed. Those are just delusions imagined by the living. Once you’re dead, that’s it. The dead don’t return, nor do they hear our wishes. It’s all an illusion. Things you forgot to say, things you couldn’t say… they want ghosts to hear them, so they dream one up. It’s also possible that people imagine their desire as ghosts.” – Mahiro Fuwa

If you manage to defeat him, then an even stronger person comes along. If you don’t have the resolve to endure that eternal struggle, then eventually your confidence will erode. But it doesn’t end there! The battle will continue elsewhere, fought by others. It’s an endless cycle! And it doesn’t end with a person’s death. The cycle will continue!

“Every day on the train it felt like there was someone who was always watching me. I used to think it was just my imagination, but when I started to realize that there was someone, I became more and more interested in him.” – Kotonoha Katsura
“Just because you like him doesn’t mean you’ll get anywhere by crossing me.” – Kotonoha Katsura
“This is a memory just for me.” – Setsuna Kiyoura
“Instead of just dawdling around, we should just clearly say it.” – Otome Katou
“If you keep lazing around, you’ll lose him to someone else. You may not be the only curious one in this world.” – Nanami Kanroji“I have not thrown my life away. I have merely gambled it. Genryūsai-dono gambled his own life on this battle. I see no reason why I should not do the same. From the moment I set foot on this battlefield, I had already left my life behind!” – Komamura Sajin
“Don’t retreat, Tetsuzaemon. No matter what. You stand firm right behind me!” – Komamura Sajin
“You are right. I have not yet introduced myself. I am Captain of the Seventh Division Komamura Sajin. And though it shames me, I am just as you say — A meager worm of a man.” – Komamura Sajin
“I was glad you did not pretend to be a saint and claim to love the world despite everything. That is why I decided that I would be your true friend. I would accept your sorrow. And I would share my joy. If you strayed I would reprimand you. If you made mistakes, I would forgive you. And when you found yourself in trouble, I would be there for you. So that you who learn to hate the world, would come to love it once more.” – Komamura Sajin
“Worry not. I have no doubt. Naught but my debt to Genryūsai-dono is what inspires my all. Everyone shunned me due to my appearance. He found me, when I was one gone astray. The debt which I owe that gentleman shall I answer with all my spirit. I do not hesitate. Should that gentleman call it justice, then even my death shall be justice!” – Komamura Sajin
“O’ anonymous friend of Tousen… If you had been there…What would you have said to stop him?” – Komamura Sajin
“You destroyed those Menos Grandes. That’s enough for me! I have decided to fight by your side! I won’t accept no as an answer, masked ones!” – Komamura Sajin
“Let us commence, Zaraki! Your favorite game of carnage!!” – Komamura Sajin
“Back then. I felt a kernel of untruth in your words. You talked about “The world she loves” many times. But made not a single mention of “The world I love”.” – Komamura Sajin
“I never thought the day would come when I would be forced to protect someone from your blade.” – Komamura Sajin
“Get down here, Tosen! Why did you become a Shingami? Was it not for your deceased friend? Was it not to carry out justice!? Where is your justice now!?” – Komamura Sajin
“If our core beliefs are truly incompatible, then attempting to solve this with words is meaningless. For the sake of Soul Society, I must strike you down. I do not wish to do so. Having heard your true beliefs, I am now satisfied. In my heart, I have already forgiven you.” – Komamura Sajin“Farewell, warrior of the sky. I pray… you don’t forgive me.” – Kira Izuru
“It increases the weight of whatever it hits, until my opponent can no longer bear the weight and falls to the ground. And then they bow their head as if in apology. That’s why it’s called “Wabisuke.”.- Kira Izuru
“You may be able to save us. If you stay and protect us. But what’s good is that everyone else dies! Please go!! Captain Komamura!!!”  – Kira Izuru
“A true warrior would never beg someone for his life.” – Kira Izuru
“Raise your head, Wabisuke.” – Kira Izuru
“Battles aren’t supposed to be heroic affairs. They are not supposed to be fun or exciting, to us every battle is filled with despair, they are dark, horrifying, grizzly. We should fear warfare, avoid it always and whenever possible choose the path of peace.” – Kira Izuru
“A grounded bird is nothing more than dinner.” – Kira Izuru
“War is not heroic. War is not exhilarating. War is full of despair. It’s dark. It’s dreadful. It’s a thing of sorrow and gloom.” – Kira Izuru“Put away your sword and you shall live…unless you’re still dreaming about defeating me. Did you forget, or did it just never occur to you…that I have Bankai as well?” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“Something as useless as emotions, I never had them to begin with.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“You and I, our levels are as distant as the earth from the heavens. Must I spell it out for you? I have discarded my left arm, discarded my left leg, and yet even then I have not nearly lowered myself to your level.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“Sovereignty means absolutely nothing in front of me.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“Let me tell you about the difference between you and me. It’s like the story of the monkey trying to capture the moon. However close he thinks he is to the moon, it’s still just the reflection of the moon in the middle of the lake. No matter how he struggles to capture that “moon”, he inevitably sinks to the bottom of that lake to no avail. You will never reach me.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“The fact that you consider yourself as an equal to me, is being arrogant in itself.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“What is that? Are you saying that this small thing is a bankai? Isn’t it just the sealed form of your zanpakutō? I see. First the execution, and now Bankai. I can see that you enjoy treading on our pride. Very well, then. I will carve into your body…The punishment for injuring our pride!” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“I… Despise the way you fight. Without ever lifting your own hand… To steal bonds of camraderie and torture opponents is the height of cowardice. It is a lack of shame deserving of death. I am here. Strike me down. I shall kill you and cast you aside… Before you finish swinging your blade.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“It is a thousand years too early… for you to become worthy enough to die by my Bankai.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“”Control”… you say? When you stand before me… that word holds no meaning. Bankai. Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“The arrogant one is you, Espada. But rest at ease. The reason for your loss is not due to that arrogance. It is simply due to a difference in power.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“Well done. That time, your fang definitely touched me.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“Be proud as someone who, after being struck by this power, is still able to retain the shape of a body.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“The curtain that falls down at the end, shall be pulled down by the blade of my sword.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“Remember that a sword held by someone who is about to die… will never be able to protect anything.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“The Kuchiki clan is one of the four noble houses. We must set the standard for all shinigami. If we do not abide by the code…then who will uphold it?” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“No matter how strong a defense, a stronger offense will always shatter it.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“Arrogance destroys the footholds of victory.” – Byakuya Kuchiki
“I don’t remember saying that I would kill you because I’m a Soul Reaper. The reason I am killing you is simple. It’s because you aimed your blade at my only pride.” – Byakuya Kuchiki“I haven’t done anything yet. Getting depressed and losing confidence is way too egotistical.” – Sorata Kanda
“It’s okay to feel depressed. It takes time to overcome things. And then, by taking that time, you just start moving forward again. That’s just what humans do.” – Mondo Oowada
“Lord Jiraiya only had praise for you. He was always boasting about you, saying you were like his own grandchild. He had faith that you were the one who would inherit his will, and truly believed that you would one day be a great Hokage. Lord Jiraiya will always watch over you. Even this very minute, he’s watching from somewhere. He wouldn’t be happy seeing you sad like this. So…be your usual self, the one he praised so much. Don’t stay depressed forever. For Lord Jiraiya himself, one of the Legendary Sannin…acknowledged you as his promising student!” – Iruka Umino
“You know why people stress over things? Because there aren’t any easy answers.” – Ai Kotani
“Cry when you’re sad. Laugh when you’re happy. Get angry when you don’t like something. Depend on someone when you’re depressed. Care for yourself before you care for others. Don’t hate anyone. Be proud of yourself. Stay loyal when you fall in love.” – Otonashi Maria
“If you let yourself get depressed, you’d be making light of the people who trust and follow you.” – Ogami Rei
“People like us aren’t qualified to be involved in a dramatic incident such as a suicide. No matter how depressed you are or how much pain you’re in, you have to return to your routine, daily life. Even if you don’t come back, you’ll just end up dying in vain. A dramatic death isn’t befitting of us.” – Kaoru Yamazaki
“Stress makes you bald, but it’s stressful to avoid stress, so you end up stressed out anyway. In the end, there’s nothing you can do.” – Gintoki Sataka
“Sorry about this, young lady, but not being able to verbalize might be a lucky break for you in a way. People can waste an awful lot of energy by putting sadness into words. Or maybe joy into words. And then of course, there’s putting anger into words. And the words can double when it comes to fear or pain. In that sense, being so afraid that you can’t find any words may save your life. Being unable to speak in extreme stress, in a body that is obligated to control energy consumption, is an act of, OH, I don’t know, maybe, self defense? Oh boy, I went and said a thing of actual intelligence there. Time to show me some love, boys!” – Graham Specter
“I’d rather have my physical pain exceed my mental pain than the other way around. By hurting myself just enough, I could turn my attention to that.” – Kusunoki
“If it’s going to be a relationship of hardship and mental agony, you should put an end to it.” – Masafumi Takeuchi
“No! I can’t take it anymore, I mean, we were just…! And anyway…! Ah, damn it! I’m so sorry… I’m so sorry… I know I’m being a dead weight, but I just can’t go on. I can barely even move!” – Yuuri Wakasa
“No person exists that is just virtuous, and kindness is only something piled on the outside. There are no humans with just virtue and fairness. Rather, they try to be that and just build up stress.” – Meme Oshino
” If we define culture as that which is healthy or humane, and defend that decision in the name of justice, once any part of that system collapses, it will cause an unimaginable number of problems for society. For instance, if I drew a line in the middle and erased one side, the next day, a new line will appear in the middle of the side that is left. I think suppressing the instincts and thoughts of the human spirit is bad. The desire for purity and wholesomeness, when taken to an extreme, is harmful.” – Rory Mercury
“Think of your shivers as excitement rather than fear. Cover the anxiety on your face with a smile.” – Kurusu Keigo
“When you get anxious about the future, it is better not to think about it. The more you think about it the more anxious you’ll get. Of course it’s important to think about what lies ahead, too, but if you only look at what’s down the road, you’ll get tangled by the “laundry” by your feet and fall, won’t you? You see, it’s also important to think about what you can do now. What you can do today, and if you keep washing things one at a time, you’ll be done before you know it. Sometimes the anxiety will start to well up, but when it does… take a little break. Read a book, watch tv, or eat soumen with everyone.” – Sohma Shigure
“When I was little, I was teased because of my weight. I tried dieting, but diets always failed. Little by little I started feeling gloomy. I got to the point where I couldn’t make friends, and I started hating myself more and more. I became completely unable to smile. I thought, no one in the world would ever like me the way I am now. But at the same time I also thought, if that’s the way it is, then I should at least like myself.” – Tsumugi Motohashi
“All those times I got hurt, all the crying I did, all the pain I felt, all the fighting I did with my life at stake… And my reward was her name and a single smile. Jeez… Talk about unequal compensation.” – Subaru Natsuki
“It was rough. It was so painful. I was so scared. I was so sad. It hurt so much, I thought I’d die. I tried so hard… I tired so hard! I was so desperate, so desperate to make everything right! It’s the truth. I’ve honestly never tried so hard at anything in my life! Because I loved this place… Because it was so important to me! I was so desperate to get back. I was scared… I was so scared! I didn’t want those eyes looking at me like that again… And I hated myself so much for feeling that way!” – Subaru Natsuki
“Living is anxiety and pain. It’s continuing to think, continuing to choose.” – Alcor
“There’s no point in having physical strength alone. The real deal needs to have mental strength and will.” – Kyomo Araragi
“Ever since I joined the survey corps, I’ve had people dying on me everyday. But… you understand, don’t you? One day or another, everyone you care about eventually dies. It’s something we simply can’t accept. It’s a realization that could drive you insane… It’s painful… so painful… I get it. And still… we must keep moving forward.” – Hange Zoe
“When I realized, I was already on the roof of a building. …I had come to hate everything. I was sick of sitting in my room holding my knees too. If nobody was going to notice or care if I died then… what’s the point in living?” – Moeka Kiryu
“I’m pathetic. I was observing the world from a safe distance. I was just scared of being hurt. I was lonely.” – Yuki Amano
“No matter how hurt someone is, they’re meant to overcome it and try to go forward.” – Mirajane Strauss
“Never forget that kindness can hurt instead of help.” – Inaba Himeko
“Do you know where hell is? Inside your head.” – Crona
“Everyone in this place is unhappy. And since they’re unhappy, they’re probably looking for someone worse off than they are.” – Lucy“Don’t use others as a reason for walking into death’s arms.” – Kisuke Urahara
“Noooo, there’s no way I, a mere handsome and sexy shopkeeper, could possibly have bankai!” – Kisuke Urahara
“Oh, it IS a chore. Risking your life and keeping busy are all the same!” – Kisuke Urahara
“Yes, we have no destiny. Only those swallowed up by ignorance and fear who take false steps, shall plunge us into the waters called “destiny.” – Kisuke Urahara
“Your transformation is not a disease. You were just given the key to the door in front of you. There’s no need to know the cause. No need for sorrow or sadness. What comes next is up to you. You can use your keys to open the door…or lock it tight. And if you do choose to open it… You can still decide not to pass through.” – Kisuke Urahara
“It’s alright! Kurosaki-san’s potential is greater than mine!” – Kisuke Urahara
“I’ll drive you into a corner and make you remember that attack.” – Kisuke Urahara
“Awaken, Benihime.” – Kisuke Urahara
“If you look at this message and think that it is the message of a person before his death… then you have no sense of humor.” – Kisuke Urahara
“Lately, I’ve been looking at these two guys only. As expected, I see flowers when there are women in the workplace… the atmosphere!” – Kisuke Urahara
“Aizen-sama will get maaaad at youuuu!” – Kisuke Urahara
“Come here you little devil, let me take a look at you! You’re my fuzzy little troublemaker, yes you are! Now who’s your daddy? Hmm?” – Kisuke Urahara
“That wasn’t very nice. I do believe you’ve killed my hat.” – Kisuke Urahara
“A warrior who has lost his ability to fight is only going to be in the way.” – Kisuke Uruhara
“There’s a lot of money…but my love is the only limited product that only you can have.” – Kisuke Uruhara
“Training hard, risking your life… what’s the difference?” – Kisuke Uruhara
“I’m so disappointed, Ichigo, so very disappointed. Sadly, your sword exhibits only fear. When you counter, it’s because you fear being killed. When you attack, you fear killing. And when you protect someone, you fear you could let them die. At this point, the only thing your sword speaks is senseless fright, and that’s not good. What you don’t need in battle is fear. Nothing will come of it.” – Kisuke Uruhara“Immaculate being… Was it? In this secular existence, perfection is an illusion, regardless of those who utter the contrary. This is the reality. Common man seeks it out, they strive to achieve it, as if it were some tangible thing… But… The fact of the matter is, perfection is a hollow shell. It is devoid of any substance. I spit on perfection. Perfection, after all, implies you’ve reached the summit. No trial and error, no ability to conceptualize. An omniscient being would have no need for such superfluous things… Am I making myself clear? For people who dabble in the sciences, such as ourselves, perfection would make us obsolete. Many magnificent things have been, and will continue to come into existence… And yet every last one of them will fall short of perfection’s finish.” – Mayuri Kurotsuchi
“I hate perfection. To be perfect is to be unable to improve any further.” – Mayuri Kurotsuchi
“Our function as men of science relies on their many shortcomings. Then, and only then, can we apply the fruits of our labor. To put it simply… As soon as you began spouting that nonsense about being an immaculate being… your fate was sealed. How dare you call yourself a man of science.” – Mayuri Kurotsuchi
“Yes, Nemu. Just smother him with those things. Worst case, he dies happy.” – Mauri Kurotsuchi
“Oh, you know what I’m talking about. That stupid line that all you Quincies keep saying up until the moment you die. By the honor of the Quincy I cannot do this, by the honor of the Quincy I won’t allow that. Quincy this, Quincy that! Every last one of you! It’s so annoying!” – Mayuri Kurotsuchi
“Arrancar, Arrancar, Arrancar… Espada! Hueco Mundo is quite the treasure trove.” – Mayuri Kurotsuchi
“A grenade that’s thrown should not come back.” – Mayuri Kurotsuchi
“Do you know what a scientist fears most in this world above all else? It’s oblivion, my friend. A scientist measures our lives in the ways we develop and expand our knowledge through myriad variations. Nothing can take its place. It’s our very soul. I have done the worst thing one scientist can do to another: I have altered your thought process. When my drug takes effect, you will find your mind has lost the ability to think.” – Kurotsuchi Mayuri
“There is no such thing as perfect in this world. That may sound cliche, but it’s the truth. The average person admires perfection and seeks to obtain it. But what’s the point of achieving perfection? There is none. Nothing. Not a single thing. I spit on perfection! If something is perfect, then there is nothing left. There is no room for imagination. No place left for that person to gain additional knowledge or abilities. Do you know what that means? For scientists such as us, perfection only brings despair. It is our job to create things more wonderful than anything before them, but never to obtain perfection.” – Kurotsuchi Mayuri
“Killing you now will be as easy as strangling a baby.” – Mayuri Kurotsuchi“That’s people for you. Trusting one another, helping one another- it’s all a fantasy. Humans are creatures that will always betray.” – Yokoya Norihiko
“Humans easily betray others. That’s just the nature of them.” – Wakabayashi Hatsuna
“Unfortunately, in reality there is no situation where one can win merely by following the rules. There will be knights that break the rules, and even chess pieces that betray him.” – Ciel Phantomhive
“Any betrayal you can see is trivial, what is truly frightening and much more lethal, is the betrayal you cannot see.” – Sosuke Aizen
“You could never betray her, because you are under her obligation. You are being let to live because of that, Zero. By me.” – Kaname Kuran
“It’s not that I don’t trust you all. It’s the opposite. I’m going because I believe in you all. You all know this well, right? No matter who betrays me, I won’t betray anyone.” – Tsubaki
“If you claim to love humans, that should include their lies and betrayals, their sins and ugliness, their jealousy and immaturity, their hatred and conflicts.” – Myouri Unzen
“Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Betrayal demands revenge. Sin must have punishment.” – Holo The Wise Wolf
“Rely on impulse and not even your thoughts can betray you.” – Kurama
“We do not live in a fairy-tale world. We cannot simply take revenge on those who have betrayed us and say “the end”. We have to live on after this. And taking revenge for betrayal only invites more revenge.” – Kraft Lawrence
“Well, everyone’s unsure of their fighting abilities. When that happens, just train more! When you’re afraid, just train! When something doesn’t feel right, just train! When you don’t believe in yourself anymore, just train! The only thing that won’t betray you is your training.” – Shio Sakaki
“Readers betray their authors.” – Miu Asakura
“I would never betray a friend. So who the hell cares if somebody betrayed you once, huh? I’m not like that!” – Yusuke Jujisaki
“Friends are treasures, help each other and value the bonds you have. Even if someone betrays you, never betray anyone yourself. And if someone’s in trouble, don’t just walk on by.” – Yusuke Fujisaki
“Are you afraid of other people? I know that by keeping others at a distance you avoid a betrayal of your trust, but you must endure the loneliness. Man can never completely erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone. Pain is something man must carry in his heart, and since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe that life is pain.” – Kaworu Nagisa
“If you don’t want to be betrayed anymore, then start by doubting the person you want to doubt the least.” – Inspector Lunge
“Without what you call absolute power, we’ll be able to live free and strong… That’s why I have to end this. Humans often betray, fight and do terrible things to each other, but if I can feel this heat and this pain in my heart, a future where everyone will be kind to each other will definitely come some day. I can believe in it now!” – Ame
“If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help, wouldn’t I be betraying him?” – Killua
“I knew it. The Earth Forces’ new mobile weapons. Father, I knew you’d betray us all!” – Cagalli Yula Athha
“Our names are given to us by God. I have betrayed God, and so I no longer have a name.” – Scar
“He may seem cold-blooded, but he’s more human and his heart is more brittle than anyone else… so much so that if you filled it with human love or betrayal, it’d break easily… which is why I think he chose to avoid it all from the start: to love humanity. Do you understand? Not to accept it, not to face it, but he chose to avoid it.”- Shinra Kishitani“Dummy. I’m not gonna dwell on what happened forever. All that junk… it’s the furthest thing on my mind. You should especially quit worrying about it and get some more sleep. Hurry up and get rid of your Panda eyes, got it?” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“I will protect Hinamori.” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“No, Kira…Run. Run until you’re out of my sight, and keep running. Otherwise…I can’t guarantee you won’t get dragged into this and be killed.” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“Aizen, I will kill you.” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“No, not yet, now that you’ve made me this serious. Regret as much as you damn well want!!” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“I’m Not An Elementary Student!!!” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“I didn’t come here to fight! I came here to hack at you violently!” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“Don’t come back… “Bed-wetter” Momo.” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“If you make Hinamori shed even one drop of blood, I’ll kill you.” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“Hyourinmaru is the strongest of all ice-type Zanpakutoes. Your weapon may have eight arms, but mine is all the water in the atmosphere! Sennen Hyourou!! ” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“Sit upon the frozen heavens! Hyōrinmaru!!” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“We are all like fireworks. We climb, shine, and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even if that time comes, let’s not disappear like a firework. Let’s continue to shine… Forever.” – Toshiro Hitsugaya
“Authority never goes anywhere without a fanfare.” – Toshiro Hitsugaya“Sensei, I want to get stronger. I’ll become a very strong Quincy and then protect everyone from Hollows. Then father will definitely agree with the way of the Quincy.” – Uryu Ishida
“Just passing by. No big deal…. Well, if you must know, I felt a sudden urge to go to Sunflower Seams, that 24-hour dressmaking shop. There’s a branch near here. That’s where I was headed at this late hour. I certainly didn’t bring this bag with me just so I would have an excuse for suddenly leaving the house because I sensed the spirit energy of a shinigami, all right?” – Uryu Ishida
“Apologize to everyone and never appear in front of me again, then I will spare your life. If you don’t, I will shoot you again with three times as much power as the last shot.” – Uryu Ishida
“I hate Shinigami.” – Uryu Ishida
“You want an attack full of “killing intent”? Then come get me. My bow is full of it.” – Uryu Ishida
“I assure you, my gratitude is sincere.” – Uryu Ishida
“I am calm. That’s why I can fight you!” – Uryu Ishida
“She knows that if she tries to help, she’ll just be in the way. Plus, even if she is able to help Kurosaki wouldn’t want her to. She knows all of this, but she is still clenching her whole body, as if trying to stop it from taking action. Inoue is waiting, praying that you will be safe, believing you will return. Don’t lose Kurosaki. If you lose, I will never forgive you!” – Uryu Ishida
“Calling me a coward, eh? At least say it so I can hear it…” – Uryu Ishida
“It’s a good thing Orihime isn’t here. I wouldn’t want her to see what I’m about to do to you.” – Uryu Ishida
“I broke the pillars on every floor on the way up. So, you’ll probably fall all the way to the bottom.” – Uryu Ishida
“Seele Schneider isn’t a sword. A Quincy’s only weapons…Are bows and arrows.” – Uryu Ishida
“You think I…am similar to Ichigo and the others? All this time, I have always stayed calm and collected… balancing each decision on the scales that you speak of… but Ichigo is a fool, so he can’t do that. When he wants to save someone, he goes to save them. Orihime-san is a fool too, and Sado is a fool. Rukia is a fool, and Abarai is a fool. If I seem to you in any way similar to that bunch of fools…that makes me very happy.” – Uryu Ishida
“Ah, Kurosaki. I’m glad to see you’ve finally realized the importance of a cape.” – Uryu Ishida
“That’s right…If I’m the first one here, I can save Kuchiki-san. Kurosaki must’ve wanted to rescue her himself…If I did it, he’d get really pissed.” – Uryu Ishida
“I swear by the pride of the Quincy…I will KILL you!” – Uryu Ishida
“Did I just get nick-named Pencil?” – Uryu Ishida
“The right to choose life or death lies with the victor. And the victor of this battle is me.” – Uryu Ishida“It isn’t even interesting fighting against someone who doesn’t have their own goals.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Playing is more important. You can work any time.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“I named you Yachiru, in memory of the only person I ever admired.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Don’t be so stuck-up. Just enjoy this! Killing and being killed. They are just a way to pass time.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“I’d forgotten it for a long time…the pain of not having a name. Those other guys had names that others called them, but I didn’t. So, that kinda feelin’.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“If you really wanted to help that Kariya reach his goals, then you would have taken care of Ichigo first. But you chose to come after me. Wasn’t that a display of your own will? The power that you have gained was all in order to defeat me. That power comes from your own grudge! Why not try giving all your strength to that end?” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“You idiot! There’s always shadows wherever there’s light!” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Oh, shut up. I was just thinkin’. With four arms, you’re just gonna keep on blockin’ my blade. That’s no fun at all. So, while I was layin’ on the ground, I was thinkin’ about how to stop you blockin’ all my attacks. But, you know…I couldn’t think up a single good idea lying down there. So I figure…I’ll just have to take out those arms, one by one.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Never admit defeat and ask for a quick death! Die first, then admit defeat! If you are defeated but didn’t die, it just means you were lucky! At those times, think only about survival! Survive and think only about killing the one who failed to kill you!” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Sorry but I’m not interested in weaklings who can’t fight any more. Besides, I don’t have any obligation to finish you off.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“I want to get stronger. I’ve finally found a worthy opponent. I can get stronger. I want to fight. I want to get stronger. It sure has been a while. To feel this desire again. I want to get stronger.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Sanity… what would I do with a useless thing like that?” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Finished? It’ll never be finished. A battle isn’t like some stupid argument. As long as someone’s still breathing, the fight isn’t over.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Loyalty to someone is different from depending on them.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Death and pain are just a small price to pay for the enjoyment of battle!” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Finished? It’ll never be finished. A battle isn’t like some stupid argument. As long as someone’s still breathing, the fight isn’t over.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Everyone who searches for power, without exception, searches for battle. Do you fight in order to become more powerful? Or do you want more power so you can fight?” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“It’s been so long that I forgot the pain of not having a name. Everyone had a name that friends use to call them, but I didn’t. That pain.” – Kenpachi Zaraki
“Don’t just accept loss or defeat! Accept it after you’re dead. If you lose without dying… it means that luck is on your side. If that happens – focus on surviving! Survive and Kill the one who couldn’t kill YOU!” – Kenpachi Zaraki“We at this moment head into the decisive battle. Have faith that our blades will not shatter. Have faith that our hearts will not waiver. And even if our paths should diverge, we all share a heart of iron. Swear that even if the ground beneath us should be rent asunder we will live and return to this place again.” – Renji Abarai
“Listen. I’m only going to say this because you’re the only one here to hear it. All this time, for almost as long as I can remember…decades at least, Rukia and I were separated by a distance so great, we couldn’t even glimpse one another. But the one who brought us back together was you. That’s why I decided. Whenever you found yourself unable to go on, I’d take you onward myself. Carry you if I had to. That’s what I’ve done up to now, and I’ll keep on doing it. Forever, until the day you die.” – Renji Abarai
“The stray dog in me is dyed into my bones… All I do is howl at the moon, but I don’t have the guts to bite…” – Renji Abarai
“Have you been out on the window ledge all this time, in plain sight? What if the neighbors report a silver haired elementary student burglar?” – Renji Abarai
“I shall light a fire upon the fang that falls short, so that I needn’t see that star…So that it shall not tear this throat of mine.” – Renji Abarai
“Only a piece of trash would slaughter a woman in cold blood. To live on as a worthless piece of trash would be just as bad as dying here now.” – Renji Abarai
“I already told you…you can’t kill me with that sword anymore!” – Renji Abarai
“We – the warriors, go now to the field of battle! Believe that our blades will not shatter! Believe that our spirits will not break! Even if we walk separate paths, our iron resolve shall remain united! Swear! That even if the ground beneath us crumbles…we shall return here, alive, again!” – Renji Abarai
“For a long time now, before I joined the Gotei 13, the only person that I have always wanted to surpass is you, Captain Kuchiki!” – Renji Abarai
“You’re just an overnight shinigami. You couldn’t put one scratch on us real ones.” – Renji Abarai
“I am really a tramp down to my bones. I hate myself. I bark at the moon, but I don’t have the courage to jump and grab it.” – Renji Abarai
“Don’t make me laugh! It is your fault that Rukia lost her power. That’s why her sentence is so heavy. Don’t you get it? It’s all because of you that Rukia is going to die! What right do you have to say you want to save her? Quit joking around.” – Renji Abarai
“If you wanna talk to me, do it while I cut you to pieces. But, I’m not gonna hold back one bit! Bankai!” – Renji Abarai
“Ichigo…I know this is shameful, but I’m begging you — Rukia…Please save Rukia!!” – Renji Abarai
“Worrying about a warrior’s life on the battlefield is only an insult.” – Renji Abarai
“A man who raises his hands on a woman is trash. If I have to become trash in order to survive… It’ll be just like dying.” – Renji Abarai
“Don’t just blame yourself. You’re not tough enough to withstand everything. Split the load, to my shoulders, and to Ichigo’s. Just stack it little by little. That’s why we’ve become stronger. Believe in him, Rukia.” – Renji Abarai
“I’ve always been afraid…Always been pretending to follow you closely, always pretending to sharpen my fangs, when the truth is…I’m scared to death just treading on your shadow.” – Renji Abarai“I’m not too fond of sad stories.” – Gin Ichimaru
“I’m a snake. Cold of flesh and devoid of heart. My tongue flicks back and forth, ever in search of new prey, and if I like what I find, I swallow ’em whole.” – Gin Ichimaru
“What idiotic rules are you talking about? You misunderstood. Even when the guardian loses, the guardian may still not open the door. If the guardian lost, then that would mean… he must be executed.” – Gin Ichimaru
“A gatekeeper ain’t supposed to open gates.” – Gin Ichimaru
“Are you afraid? You don’t want to die, do you? Not just Abarai, if anyone… acts upon the thought of not wanting you to die, you will suddenly begin to fear your impending death, right?” – Gin Ichimaru
“I was just taking a walk and I dropped by to tease you.” – Gin Ichimaru
“It would have been nice if my capture lasted a little longer. Farewell, Rangiku. Sorry.” – Gin Ichimaru
“Bye Bye, Rukia chan! See ‘ya at the execution grounds.” – Gin Ichimaru
“If you were to turn into a snake tomorrow and began devouring humans, and from the same mouth you devoured humans, you cried out to me, “I Love You!” Would I still be able to say “I Love You,” the same way I do today?” –  Gin Ichimaru
“I thought you were interesting before, but now you’re just a creepy kid.” – Gin Ichimaru
“If you pull your sword in a place like this, I’ll just have to stop you, won’t I?” – Gin Ichimaru
“There isn’t even water! Huh? Then how’d we have tea earlier?” – Gin Ichimaru
“I’ve decided. I’m going to become a Shinigami. Become a Shinigami and change things. So that they’ll end… without Rangiku having to cry.” – Gin Ichimaru
“It’s easier to crush a dream than realize one. Forming a bond is infinitely more difficult than breaking one.” – Gin Ichimaru
“Emotions? Nope, I’ve got nothing like that. I told you when we first met, didn’t I? I’m a snake. With cold skin, no emotions, that slithers around searching for prey with its tongue, swallowing down whatever looks tasty.” – Gin Ichimaru“It’s like, even though we’re human, we can just spend time here in Hueco Mundo like it’s normal now. Helping out all the Arrancar people, doing our best to help the Shinigami protect their home…it’s just kind of nice, don’t you think? I kind of wish things could stay like this forever. All of us together, helping each other out, trying to do what’s best for everyone’s worlds…and one day we look back and realize the start of the war just never came.” – Orihime Inoue
“I’m a terrible person, aren’t I? “If only Kurosaki-kun would cheer up, I’d be happy.” At least, I thought that was how I felt. Then Kuchiki-san came back and cheered Kurosaki-kun up. I should have been really happy, but… but… [starts to cry] but instead I’m jealous of Kuchiki-san!” – Orihime Inoue
“We don’t look any different from those shinigami. We just dress differently.” – Orihime Inoue
“I was proud of my hair color that my brother admired. I was happy to be told such things, so I grew my hair out ever since I was little. Soon after I entered middle school, 3rd years said they didn’t like my hair color and cut it. I had no choice but to cut the rest short to even it out. I couldn’t tell brother.’I felt like changing it’, is what I said to dodge the question. Then my brother died soon after. I became alone. I stopped talking, even at school, and became more alone than ever before. The one who stopped me from being that way was Tatsuki-chan. Tatsuki-chan yelled at me for backing down and she looked out for me. I could grow my hair out again thanks to her. I will never have short hair again, because my long hair is proof of my faith in Tatsuki-chan.” – Orihime Inoue
“If I were the rain, that binds together the heavens and the earth, whom in all eternity will never mingle, would I be able to bind two hearts together?” – Orihime Inoue
“I don’t care about “subtle”. If you don’t want to get hurt, then don’t attack until I say it’s all right.” – Orihime Inoue
“Thank you, Tatsuki. Please do not worry, Tatsuki. Because Tatsuki will come find me, that’s why I can go anywhere without worry. If the place I’m going is somewhere Tatsuki can’t go, then please wait for me here, I will come back for sure. Come back to Tatsuki’s side.” – Orihime Inoue
“I don’t believe that he showed me the Hōgyoku because he trusts me… but, at least I have learned the location of the Hōgyoku… and… about my own power, too. Everything that has occurred… it reverses it all, and destroys the very event itself. Thank you, Kurosaki-kun, for coming to save me, but I’ve found something I must do here. And it’s definitely…something only I can do. With my power… I will return the Hōgyoku to before it ever existed!” – Orihime Inoue
“That’s right. To begin with, I came here just thinking I wanted to protect everyone. But when I heard they had come to save me, I couldn’t help but feel a little glad, just a bit in my heart. When I look at Kurosaki-kun in that mask, I think that he might not have come here to save me at all. Even though it’s wrong, they shouldn’t be going that far for me.” – Orihime Inoue
“I will not forgive those who hurt Tatsuki!” – Orihime Inoue
“There were a lot of things I wanted to do. I wanted to become a teacher, and an astronaut, and a baker… I wanted to go to a bunch of different donut shops and ask for one of everything! And I wanted to tell the ice-cream man to give me one of everything, too! I wish I could have five different lives! Then I could have been born in five different towns, and eaten five lifetime’s worth of food, and had five different careers, and… fallen in love with the same person, five times.” – Orihime Inoue
“It’s just that… It’s just that not being able to fight with everyone makes me feel lonely! But what would make me feel worse than being lonely is getting in everyone’s way… that would make me feel worse! If it means getting in the way of Kurosaki-kun and everyone… then I would rather be lonely, very lonely.” – Orihime Inoue
“Kurosaki-kun… I’m weak, so it’s always like I turn back to look to you for help. But now I won’t turn back and I’ll go forward. The next time we meet I won’t look to you for help, Kurosaki-kun, I’ll be able to fight on my own.” – Orihime Inoue
“It’s impossible to feel exactly the same as someone else… but when you both care for each other, your hearts are able to draw a little closer together. I think that’s what it means to make your hearts as one.” – Orihime Inoue
“People are all evil. In order to falsely believe yourself to be just, you must inevitably falsely believe that someone else is more evil than you.” – Orihime Inoue
“When people constantly show their affection for you, you start taking it for granted. If you don’t realize how much they care for you until they’re gone, you’ll only be left with regret and remorse.” – Orihime Inoue“Kurosaki Ichigo, you have no chance of defeating me. Even if you somehow manage to defeat me, there will be three more powerful than myself for you to fight. It doesn’t matter if you stand up again a thousand times. The road to victory does not exist.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“If there is such a thing like happiness in this world, it should resemble the endless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing and having nothing to lose. If that isn’t happiness… then what is?” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“Do not allow yourself to be shaken. Do not weaken your stance. Open your senses. And do not let your guard down for an instant.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“I see. So you show no mercy. Just like a true Hollow. I care not. Defeated by you as I stand, my existence holds no further meaning. Do it.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“Kurosaki Ichigo, those are the words of someone who does not know true despair. So I will show you. This is what true despair looks like.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“What is there, over there? There is nothing. I was born in a bottom of a pit where no light shone. As if pressed together by the darkness. Untouched by everything at all. Born under those dark, dark sediments. I had a white form. My comrades were all in pure black. In those black forms with their eyes shining and teeth baring they were certainly eating something. And then… There was nothing to me, except my eyes. I felt nothing. No rather… It was possible that what I felt was “void”, yet. I could hear nothing, I could bite nothing, I could smell nothing, I could feel nothing as I touch, I could not rest. I had no companion. Just walking, alone. The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“Let me inform you…All of your dreams are to be thrown away.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“If it is because of what you call a heart, then it is the heart that causes you humans pain. It is because of your heart that you will die.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“We are nothingness. Our head is a void. And without anything around us, we are nothing. We become what we perceive.” – Ulquiorra Cofer
“What would you have me say? “Don’t worry, I’m sure he’s still alive.”? Ridiculous. I am not here to comfort you. I don’t understand why are you so fixated on life and death? At any rate, your friends will soon be annihilated. So what if that’s one step closer? They should have seen this coming from the start. If they couldn’t see it coming, the fault lies in their own foolishness. Laughing them off as a group of idiots would be sufficient. Why can’t you do that? If it were me, and my friends entered Hueco Mundo without first gauging their strength, I’d be infuriated by their stupidity.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“Those who know despair, once knew hope. Those who know loss, once knew love.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
” Am I frightening… woman?” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“Even saying they were just a bunch of fools would suffice. So why can’t you? Were it me… I would be angry at the ignorance of those who would enter Hueco Mundo… without even testing their own power.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“Your heart? You humans say that word so lightly. As if it were something one can hold in the palm of one’s hand. But my eye sees everything — Nothing can escape it. What it doesn’t see doesn’t exist. That’s how I’ve always fought. That’s how I’ve always lived.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“You’re just in time. Watch closely. This is the moment that the man you’ve put your hope in will lose his life.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“It seems I have overestimated you quite a bit. Your evolution did not even satisfy my expectations. This is the end.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“So you can withstand my Cero even without your mask… You’ve gotten stronger. Is it because you defeated Grimmjow? Or…Is it because of her? [Motions to Inoue] Or maybe because of your friends, still fighting down below. That girl is already one of us. Even if you manage to rescue her, that won’t change. Rescuing her…Is meaningless.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“I was not capable of stopping it even while using both hands. That surprised me a little. Was that your full power? Well, it seems to be… disappointing.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“What is a heart? If I rip open your chest, will I find it there? If I crack open your skull, will I find it there?” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“You are a fool, Ichigo Kurosaki. You willingly seek to challenge an opponent so much more powerful than you that it strikes a primal fear into your being. Incomprehensible. If this is the work of the ‘heart’ that you people speak of, then it is because you possess this ‘heart’ that you humans bring hurt upon yourself, because you possess this ‘heart’ that you lose your lives.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“If there is such a thing like happiness in this world, it should resemble the endless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing and having nothing to lose. If that isn’t happiness… then what is?” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“Kill me. Make it quick. I no longer have the strength left in me to even walk. If you do not cut me down now, then this will go unsettled for eternity.” – Ulquiorra Cifer“If it’s not enough to believe in justice, then I will become justice. I will seek out all evil in this world and wipe them out like the clouds in the sky. I swear I will…For justice.” – Tousen Kaname
“Justice without a great cause begets nothing more than slaughter. That same slaughter in a great cause…Is Justice.” – Tousen Kaname
“I never overcame my shyness and told her that I actually liked clouds.” – Tousen Kaname
“I told you before, Komamura. The only paths that I see with these eyes are the ones not dyed with blood. Those paths are the paths to justice. So whichever path I choose…Is justice.” – Tousen Kaname
“Open my eyes? You? Open my eyes? You never change.” – Tousen Kaname
“I see. It’s understandable. You are a demon. You belong in the darkness. So of course you do not fear it.” – Tousen Kaname
“I knew it would. Someday we would cross swords and one of us will die.” – Tousen Kaname
“I do not hate you. However, to protect our peaceful existence, there is no other way!” – Tousen Kaname
“I am afraid. Then and now, my fear has always been that I would die a shinigami like you.” – Tousen Kaname
“Don’t make me laugh. Aizen-sama has given me something far more powerful than a bankai.” – Tousen Kaname
“It must make you sick to know an underling like me is going to kill you.” – Tousen Kaname
“I did not say that I hate you. What I mean to say is that you are unforgivable!!” – Tousen Kaname
“I was trying to chop off your head from the eye up. A little scratch counts as a miss.” – Tousen Kaname
“I can see! I can see! I can see!!! So this is the sky!! So this is blood!! So this is the world!! …So this is what you look like. Komamura. You are uglier… than I thought.” – Tousen Kaname
“Aren’t you clever? Is that supposed to be sarcastic?” – Tousen Kaname
“Justice is not something that you can express in words.” – Tousen Kaname
“Those who do not fear the sword they wield, have no right to wield a sword at all.” – Tousen Kaname“The one hundred years we were apart were meant to bring me power and make you weak! Yoruichi!” – Soi Fon
“Why didn’t you take me with you!? Yoruichi?” – Soi Fon
“Showing your back in a battle? You’ve become a fool Yoruichi!” – Soi Fon
“I’ll show you a real assassination. No… Maybe you won’t even be able to see it.” – Soi Fon
“Such words are wasted on someone like me.” – Soi Fon
“I’m inadequate in everything.” – Soi Fon
“You know the power of my zanpakuto, Suzumebachi. If someone gets hit twice in the same spot… They die!” – Soi Fon
“Things like protecting the world are no more than moral reasons that sound good.” – Soi Fon
“I thought I told you. If you see your allies losing, that’s your chance. Don’t step between them. Take the enemy down from behind. And if the enemy’s so strong, you can’t even do that, then just watch your allies get killed. That’s what it means to be Special Forces.” – Soi Fon
“Of my five older siblings, two died on the first mission, then two more on the second. Then on the sixth mission, the last one… Died as well. I felt sad, somewhat, but more than that, I felt ashamed of their incompetence.” – Soi Fon“I finally understand… I’m alone. I won’t believe in anyone, or love anyone. I’m alone.” – Gaara
“This is where it all starts for me. Starting with this small bond. I too want to become someone who is needed, instead of a weapon that is feared. And as the Kazekage of Sunagakure.” – Gaara
“Up until now, my bonds with others have only been ones of hatred and murder. But, seeing him fight so hard made me wonder what a bond really is. I think I understand a little now. Suffering, sadness…and joy. To be able to share it with another person. Naruto Uzumaki…when I fought him, I feel that is what he taught me.” – Gaara
“He was the one who taught me to deepen my bond with my people. Thanks to him, I was able to regain my true self. That village has him, the one who cherishes a friend’s bond more than anyone I know. Naruto Uzumaki… Knowing him and the friends he holds so dear, they will overcome this disaster and grow even stronger from it.” – Gaara
“You’re the same then. When you feel the honor of your idol under scrutiny… you become enraged, as if it were your own honor being questioned. The more precious your idol is to you… the harder you fight for him.” – Gaara
“I know him well. He takes too many risks when it comes to his friends…that’s why.” – Gaara
“A soul needs a purpose to live…and so I concluded that my purpose was to kill everyone besides myself. I felt alive…” – Gaara
“I am a relic they want to get rid of, so why do I exist and live? In order to exist you need a purpose, to exist for no reason is the same as being dead… I would love only myself and fight for only myself. If all other people exist to magnify that love, then there is no more a splendid universe than this one…” – Gaara
“It’s too bad I don’t think of you as anything. If you get in my way… I’ll kill you.” – Gaara
“Naruto… Just so you know, there will be a war to protect the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails. In other words – you. For the sake of the ninja world and as the Kazekage, I will guard you with my life. If as a member of Akatsuki, Sasuke Uchiha stands in the way of the ninja coalition… I will show him no mercy.” – Gaara
“Bitter crimson tears flow from lifeless eyes, and mingle with the endless sands… Bestowing ever greater power upon the demon god.” – Gaara
“If you’re truly prepared to take up the mantle of a Kage, then as Sasuke’s friend, you know what you have to do.” – Gaara
“Family? Let me tell you what kind of link I have with them. They are just lumps of meat linked by hatred and murderous intent!” – Gaara
“One day I’d like to become something precious to others.” – Gaara
“I took the life of the woman I was supposed to call mother in the process of being born… in order to become the world’s strongest shinobi… I became the incarnation of sand…” – Gaara
“Three times now… We’ve fought world wars for our own nations, our own villages. We’ve hurt one another. We’ve hated one another. That hatred bred a lust for power, and that lust for power created ME. I was a Jinchuuriki, the embodiment of hatred and power. And I hated this world, and all the people in it… I wanted to destroy it with my own hands. The exact same thing Akatsuki is trying to do today. But one man, one ninja from Konoha stopped me. I was his enemy, yet he wept for me! I hurt him, yet he called me his friend! He saved me! My enemy, my fellow Jinchuuriki… He suffered the same pain as me, yet bore no ill will! There are no enemies here because we’ve all suffered at Akatsuki’s hand!” – Gaara
“You can make a rain of 1,000 needles. I will make it rain blood.” – Gaara
“I think of you as a friend. I used to think “friend” was just another word… Nothing more, nothing less. But when I met you, I realized what was important was the word’s meaning.” – Gaara
“You have the same eyes as I do…the eyes, filled with hatred and death, that long for strength… Just like mine. Your eyes tell me how badly you wish to kill the one who put you through the hell called loneliness.” – Gaara
“Perhaps the companionship of an evil person is preferable to loneliness.” – Gaara
“Just because someone is important to you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that, that person is good. Even if you knew that person was evil… People cannot win against their loneliness.” – Gaara
“People cannot win against their loneliness.” – Gaara
“Now there’s something I understand a little better. Hate, sadness, even joy. To be able to share it with another person… Naruto Uzumaki. From fighting him I learned that. He knew pain like I did and then he taught me that you can change your path. I wish that one day I can be needed by someone. Not as a frightening weapon… But as the sand’s Kazekage.” – Gaara
“In order to escape a road of solitude, one has to work hard, and forge a new path with their own power.” – Gaara
“We have walked through the darkness of this world, that’s why we are able to see even a sliver of light.” – Gaara
“If love is just a word, then why does it hurt so much if you realize it isn’t there?” – Gaara
“He was the one who taught me to deepen my bond with my people. Thanks to him, I was able to regain my true self. That village has him, the one who cherishes a friend’s bond more than anyone I know. Naruto Uzumaki… Knowing him and the friends he holds so dear, they will overcome this disaster and grow even stronger from it.” – Gaara
“Peace under an illusion is not true peace. It’s only meaningful if the real world manages to accomplish it.” – Gaara“I can’t think of a more fitting destination for a demon ninja, can you?! I’m told there are many demons down there – of all shapes and sizes! Oh yes, I should fit right in! You, on the other hand, Gatō… Well,I fear you’re in for a long and very painful eternity!” – Zabuza Momochi
“You were always at my side, the least I can do is to be beside you at the end. I know it cannot be, but I wish I could go to where you have gone. How I wish I could join you there, Haku.” – Zabuza Momochi
“Even the unremarkable Demon of the Hidden Mist can die and become a real Demon in hell! This will be fun!!! We’ll have plenty of time to see if I’m a baby devil down in hell!” – Zabuza Momochi
“His soul was as pure as snow.” – Zabuza Momochi
“When you’ve hovered between life and death so many times that it doesn’t faze you, you may be called a ninja. When you’ve become so deadly that your profile has been entered into my bingo book, then you may have earned the title ninja.” – Zabuza Momochi
“Uh uh…I won’t be joining Haku. Where he’s gone I cannot follow. We wouldn’t be welcome where Haku’s gone to. Hell’s where WE’RE going, Gatō!” – Zabuza Momochi
“I died as a human!” – Zabuza Momochi
“You’re right. Those little people and their little dreams, why should I care about them?! I have my own dream!” – Zabuza Momochi
“You talk too much, kid… Your words cut deep, deeper than any blade.” – Zabuza Momochi
“Well? Cat got your tongue? Are you so surprised to discover that I’m human? Even shinobi are human. No matter how hard we try, we always fail to escape that simple fact. Well at least, I have failed.” – Zabuza Momochi
“When I was your age, my hands were already soaked in blood…” – Zabuza Momochi
“Shut up kid, Haku’s already dead… As I was used by Gatō, I used Haku. That was all. I’ve said it already… in the world of shinobi, there are only those who use and those whom are used. We shinobi are simply tools… what I wanted was his blood, not him… I have no regrets.” – Zabuza Momochi
“You don’t need to say any more… It pained him to have to fight you… Haku fought not only for me… he fought for you guys too. He was too kind. I’m glad I got to face you guys in the end. You may be right… a shinobi is still a human… we may not be able to become emotionless tools.” – Zabuza Momochi“It’s stupid to talk about things you’re not. Be yourself and you’ll be fine.” – Nara Shikamaru
“It’s not because I’m lazy, it’s just because I don’t care.” – Nara Shikamaru
“C’mon. You know what they’re like. You can never figure them out. You never know where you could stand with them. The smallest things could put you in their bad side. Always playing little mind games with you. Trying to make you do what they want. They’re just a big pain basically.” – Nara Shikamaru
“How many times do I have to tell you? The first move is always a feint. It’s the most basic thing, to land a hit with the second move.” – Nara Shikamaru
“There’s no advantage to hurrying through life.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Oh man… those clouds are so lucky. so free. More to the point, I didn’t feel like doing this in the first place. And I only became a ninja because I thought life would’ve been more interesting as one… I suppose things aren’t gonna be that simple.” – Nara Shikamaru
“In life, nothing good comes out of hurrying.” – Nara Shikamaru
“If women made you a better person, I wouldn’t want to know what you were like before.” – Nara Shikamaru
“He turned a room full of strangers into a room full of enemies with just one sentence.” – Nara Shikamaru
“It really doesn’t matter to me if I ever become a chūnin or not, but I guess I shouldn’t let myself be beaten by a female, so let’s do it.” – Nara Shikamaru
“We’re not stupid enough to go out there planning to die.” – Nara Shikamaru
“That pathetic Lord Jashin or whatever isn’t your God anymore. I am. The only one bringing down vengeance is me.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Sometimes I wish I was just a cloud, floating along.” – Nara Shikamaru
“My master entrusted me with a lot, from big things to little things. It’s the same for you an unlimited number of things, don’t you think it’s about time for us, to be the ones who entrust not the entrusted, it’s a pain in the ass but I can’t say that. Someday you’ll be the one to treat others to ramen and you’ll be called Master Naruto… We can’t stay kids forever, like Asuma and Jiraiya, I wanna be as cool as them.” – Nara Shikamaru
“I never really liked Sasuke, but all the same, he’s a member of the Hidden Leaf village, he’s a comrade and I’ll put my life on the line to help him, that’s the way of our village. I know I usually seem like a pretty lazy guy, but not today. Because now, I’m responsible for your lives too.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Subtle as a rhino… she might even be scarier than my mom.” – Nara Shikamaru
“How many times do I have to tell you? The first move is always a feint.” – Nara Shikamaru
“You would think just this once, when it was life or death, I could pull through.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Ughh. Great. What’s the point in setting the alarm if I’m going to wake up before it goes off? What a total waste. Now I’ve gotta shut it off but I don’t feel like moving. But if I don’t shut it off it will just keep ringing and ringing. Sigh. It makes me tired just thinking about the whole thing. Some mornings are such a drag…” – Nara Shikamaru
“When you have that kid, I’ll have to protect it. So I’ve gotta grow up to be a cool adult too!” – Nara Shikamaru
“See, you and I have different beliefs. I believe in the Will of Fire.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Someday, I just want to marry a regular girl who isn’t too ugly and not too pretty. Have two children, first a girl, then a boy. Retire after my daughter is married and my son becomes a successful ninja, and spend the rest of my life playing shōgi or Go. Then die of old age before my wife.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Regardless of our limitations, we can always be of some use. Our power may seem insignificant… but it may just prove to be useful in the grand scheme of things. Stay focused. Never avert your eyes, because if an opening arises, even our insignificant power may be enough to determine the fate of the world. Which is why everyone must stay alert and ready to strike at any moment!” – Nara Shikamaru
“It’s because we help out when they’re in trouble that we can count on them to come running when we need it.” – Nara Shikamaru

The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It’s because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you’ll eventually become just like Madara.

I got tired of waiting, so I was just thinking of calling and leaving you a voice mail. I’ve watched ya. I saw you kill your childhood sword buddy. I even chuckled when you shed that imaginary friend of yours. You’ve grown into a fine killer. But you’re still vulnerable. Like your daddy you’re soft on the inside.

“I really am… shinobi trash. But the one thing I still learned is this. That void is something that everyone helps you fill. Just because you face adversity and hardships, is no reason to give up on this world. A person willing to throw away all those memories… of their friends and comrades, will never find peace of mind. Resorting to something like that isn’t going to bury that hole. If you persevere and endure, someone will be there to support you!” – Hatake Kakashi
“The hole in one’s heart gets filled by others around you. Friends won’t flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don’t go the way he wants them to. That won’t help fill the hole in your heart. And people won’t help those who run away and do nothing. As long as you don’t give up, there will always be salvation.” – Hatake Kakashi

Neither you, nor me, not even God himself. But that unbearable vacancy in the throne of Heaven shall be filled. From this day forth, I will stand in heaven.” – Sosuke Aizen
“All of the Arrancar follow me… because they see me as fearless and the only individual who can actually bring forth the new world… the new future where you can belong. Without me, that dream can’t be fulfilled and without me the gotei 13 will destroy you all… Do you see it now from my point of view?” – Sosuke Aizen
“Seek not beauty in battle. Seek not beauty in death. Consider not your own life. If you wish to protect that which must be protected, then strike while your opponent’s back is turned.” – Sosuke Aizen
“I had no intention of deceiving anyone. It’s just that none of you could understand…My true self.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Why are you putting so much distance between us? If you want to make sure it hits me, then you should get close and fire. Or is it that you’re afraid of letting even a part of me out of your field of vision by getting close? If that’s the case, then it’s a foolish thought. Distance only has meaning in a fight between equals. With you and I, distance holds no meaning at all. Watch… If I do this, my hand is almost instantly at your heart.” – Sosuke Aizen
“No matter what may happen… As long as you walk by my side… There shall be no enemy that can stand before us.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Ichigo Kurosaki, all of the battles you’ve fought, were all part of my plan.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Oh? I thought I severed your body from the waist-down, but…It seems the cut was too shallow.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Yhwach. You desired a world… Where fear would no longer be a burden. But… In a world without fear of death… People will never attain the hope that is to be found from casting their fears aside and preserving through them. While it is true that people can continue to press forward through the simple act of living… That is no way comparable to marching forward in the face of death, while doing their damnedest to keep it at bay. That is why… That is why people have given that very march a unique and special name. “COURAGE.” – Sosuke Aizen
“A girl like you should smile more often. Overcast skies blot out the sun, and that always brings people’s spirits down. So why not let the sun shine…For just a while longer?” – Sosuke Aizen
“Aww…You found her. Sorry, I didn’t want you to find out this way…No. I should have chopped her into little pieces and hidden them away where you would never find them.” – Sosuke Aizen
“I’m going to have to ask you to stop now, Abarai-kun. I can only step on an ant so hard without crushing it.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Isn’t it ironic, king of Hueco Mundo? Dressed in black and poised to attack, you look just like a shinigami.” – Sosuke Aizen
“All creatures want to believe in something bigger than themselves. They cannot live without blind obedience. And to escape the pressure of that trust, those in whom faith is placed in turn look for someone higher than themselves. And then those people in turn look for someone even stronger. That is how all Kings are born. That is how all Gods are born.” – Sosuke Aizen
“In my eyes, there is no difference between wiping away one speck of dust or two.” – Sosuke Aizen
“You are fighting out of obligation, not out of hatred. You will never reach me like that. Battle without hatred is like a bird without wings. You’ll never defeat anyone like that. Your powerless friends are just weights that will break your legs.” – Sosuke Aizen
“A victor must speak not of the current state of the world, but of how it should rightfully be.” – Sosuke Aizen
“We’re all the same. No one really remembers the day he was born. We all have to trust another’s word on the matter. It doesn’t matter if it’s true or not. Just having a birthday makes one happy I think.” – Sosuke Aizen
“There is no such thing as “truth” or “lies” in this world; there never has been. There are only plain, hard facts. And yet, all beings who exist in this world acknowledge only those “facts” that are convenient to them, and take them to be the “truth”. They do so because they know no other way of living. However, for those powerless beings who comprise the majority of this world’s population, inconvenient facts that affirm their very existence, are their only truth.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Admiration is the furthest thing from understanding.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Fear is necessary for evolution. The fear that could be destroyed at any moment.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Laws exist only for those who cannot live without clinging to them.” – Sosuke Aizen
“We think the flower on the precipice is beautiful, because our fear makes our feet stop at its edge, instead of stepping forward into the sky, like that flower.” – Sosuke Aizen
“I guess it’s only natural for inferior beings to ride on the coattails of their superior counterparts. If they wish to keep their lives, they have no choice but to obediently comply. It’s a never ending chain… as the ones who are burdened with that trust, in order to escape that burden, seek to find someone even greater than themselves. These greater beings then seek others even greater than themselves to shelter them. This is how Gods are born. But make no mistake. They all still abide to me. Because from this point onward, you will witness first hand, the power of the God they foolishly placed their faith in. I will become that God they have no choice but to believe in.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Any betrayal you can see is trivial, what is truly frightening and much more lethal, is the betrayal you cannot see.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Trusting someone… means relying on them and only the weak do that.” – Sosuke Aizen
“I never ask them to trust me at all. I told them to come with me but I never told them to trust me. And I always tell them not to trust anyone, including myself. But sadly, there are not many strong enough to do that.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Good evening, Espada. There has been an enemy attack. But first… Let us brew some tea.” – Sosuke Aizen“I’m willing to do whatever I can to help because I trust you. But why couldn’t you trust me?” – Ruby Rose
“Not many people have an appreciation for the classics these days.” – Ruby Rose
“I don’t wanna be “the bee’s knees”. I don’t wanna be any kind of “knees”! I just wanna be a normal girl, with normal knees.” – Ruby Rose
“You’re a Huntress! Can I have your autograph?!” – Ruby Rose
“We’ve all lost something, and I’ve seen what loss can do to people. But if we gave up every time we lost, then we’d never be able to move forward.” – Ruby Rose
“I’m not trying to show off. I want you to know I can do this!” – Ruby Rose
“I don’t need people to help me grow up. I drink milk.” – Ruby Rose
“You told me once that bad things just happen. You were angry when you said it, and I didn’t want to listen. But you were right. Bad things do happen, all the time, every day. Which is why I’m out here, to do whatever I can, wherever I can, and hopefully do some good.” – Ruby Rose
“As a girl, I wanted to be just like those heroes in the books… Someone who fought for what was right, and protected people who couldn’t protect themselves!” – Ruby Rose
“I don’t care what you say! We WILL stop them, and I WILL stop you! BET ON THAT!” – Ruby Rose
“You’ve got a team now, Jaune. We both do. And if we fail, then, we’ll just be bringing them down with us. We have to put our teammates first, and ourselves second. Your team deserves a great leader, Jaune. And I think that can be you.” – Ruby Rose
“Why would I need friends if I have you?” – Ruby Rose
“You’re about to see a whole different side of me today, Weiss, and after it’s all over, you’re going to be like, ‘Wow! That Ruby girl is really, really cool… and I wanna be her friend!” – Ruby Rose
“We’ve never backed down before, and we’re not going to start now.” – Ruby Rose
“No more awkward small talk or ‘getting-to-know-you’ stuff. Today, I get to let my sweetheart do the talking.” – Ruby Rose
“Of course I’m happy with Crescent Rose. I just really like seeing new ones. It’s like meeting new people… but better.” – Ruby Rose
“Well, I’m sorry you need my help to win a fight. I’m just fine on my own!” – Ruby Rose
“You think just because you’ve got nuts and bolts instead of squishy guts makes you any less real than me?” – Ruby Rose
“We Schnees are unique. Unlike many, our Semblance is hereditary. But that doesn’t mean it will come easily. Your Semblance is like a muscle. The more you practice with it, the stronger it will become. But if you only focus on one aspect of it, if you fail to test the limits of what you think is possible, then you’ll never truly grow.” – Winter Schnee
“I don’t recall asking about your ranking, I’m asking how you’ve been. Are you eating properly? Have you taken up any hobbies? Are you making new friends?” – Winter Schnee
“It sounds to me like you have two choices in front of you. You can either call him, beg for his money back, and explain once more why you would want to study at Beacon over Atlas, or you could continue to explore Remnant, discovering more about the world and honestly, more about yourself.” – Winter Schnee
“If this is what you call trying, then you have no hope of winning the tournament, let alone succeeding as a Huntress!” – Winter Schnee
“Emotions can grant you strength, but you must never let them overpower you.” – Winter Schnee
“I’m not always going to be around to save you, Weiss.” – Winter Schnee
“Greetings, Ruby Rose. I wish to thank you for taking an interest in my sister.” – Winter Schnee
“You’ve grown up a bit, haven’t you? You’re not the little girl clinging to the family name anymore.” – Winter Schnee
“Your Semblance is like a muscle. The more you practice with it, the stronger it will become. But if you only focus on one aspect of it…if you fail to test the limits of what you think is possible…then you’ll never truly grow.” – Winter Schnee
“Only a novice would refer to that as a victory. I counted at least three strikes missed.” – Winter Schnee
“You can’t just buy trust like everything else! You have to earn it!” – Winter Schnee
“I wish to inspect them to make sure they are up to my personal standards.” – Winter Schnee
“If you won’t hold your tongue, then I will gladly remove it for you!” – Winter Schnee
“I feel like I wish I could do both the things I need to do and the things I want to do. Is that normal?” – Penny Polendina
“Let’s talk more later! I can’t wait to hear about all of your adventures and tell you how I have been and I am just very excited about the whole experience!” – Penny Polendina
“I guess we all have to do some things we would rather not.” – Penny Polendina
“I just wanted to say how excited I am to be working with you in a professional capacity. As friends!” – Penny Polendina
“Most girls are born, but I was made. I’m the world’s first synthetic person capable of generating an Aura! I’m not real.” – Penny Polendina
“You called me friend! Am I really your friend?” – Penny Polendina
“Do hugs always feel this warm inside?” – Penny Polendina
“It is such a pleasure to see you all again!” – Penny Polendina
“I don’t have a lot of friends; but if I did, I’d want them to talk to me about things.” – Penny Polendina
“I still want to know what happened to my mother and why she left me, but I will never let that search control me.” – Yang Xiao Long
“I can’t take it anymore! Could everyone just chill out for two seconds before something CRAZY happens again?!” – Yang Xiao Long
“Having some trouble there, lady-killer?” – Yang Xiao Long
“Did she make that promise to you? Or to the person you were pretending to be?” – Yang Xiao Long
“I’m a thrill-seeker. I want to travel around the world and get wrapped up in as many crazy adventures as I can. And if I help people along the way, then that’s even better. It’s a win-win, y’know?” – Yang Xiao Long
“Oh, I can’t believe my baby sister is going to Beacon with me! This is the best day ever!” – Yang Xiao Long
“I always kick my semester off with a “Yang”!” – Yang Xiao Long
“I’m sorry, I just… I don’t think you know what it’s like to be left. You have a giant family, recitals to perform at, dinners to attend. I didn’t have any of that. My mom left me. Ruby’s mom left too. Tai was always busy with school and Ruby couldn’t even talk yet. I had to pick up the pieces. I had to keep things together. Alone.” – Yang Xiao Long
“You can spout off whatever you want, but nothing is going to keep me from my sister.” – Yang Xiao Long
“I want a life where I don’t know what tomorrow will bring. And that will be a good thing.” – Yang Xiao Long
“At least you two have something that drives you. I’ve just always, gone with the flow, you know.” – Yang Xiao Long
“There’s no such thing as negative friends. You just made one friend and one enemy!” – Yang Xiao Long
“I lost a part of me. A piece of me is gone and it’s never coming back.” – Yang Xiao Long
“I’m going to do everything I can to defend this kingdom. No matter the cost.” – James Ironwood
“This is the right move, Ozpin. I promise, I will keep our people safe; you have to trust me.” – James Ironwood
“Be ready for anything. We don’t know what state Penny is in.” – James Ironwood
“I refuse to believe that a man that I’ve trusted for so long would act so… passively.” – James Ironwood
“The council’s given me custody over you for as long as I see fit. So you can make yourself comfortable. I can be sure that you’ll have plenty of time to talk.” – James Ironwood
“Many have described these as uncertain times. And while that may be the case for the rest of the world, I can tell you what is certain: the Kingdom of Atlas will remain strong… and it will remain safe. That is my promise.” – James Ironwood
“The people of Vale needed someone to protect them, someone who would act. When they look to the sky and see my fleet, they feel safe, and our enemies will feel our strength.” – James Ironwood“You can always change the way you live. No matter what you do, how you want to live is up to you.” – Setsuna
“Too naive. Does your world forgive anyone who apologizes?” – Setsuna
“First, I do not know this Sesshōmaru who you claim is my father. Why in the world must we atone for such a demon’s failure. If Kirinmaru must be defeated then have that Sesshōmaru deal with it. Tree of Ages, you’re asking the wrong people.” – Setsuna
“If you truly are my older sister, then prove it to me with your strength.” – Setsuna
“I can hear her. Towa’s voice. Towa’s calling to me. I can hear her!” – Setsuna
“Towa, now is a good time to warn you. In the Feudal Age, there is no room for “hesitation.” If you don’t kill your enemy, they will kill you.” – Setsuna
“I was just thinking that since we’re cousins, I’d try to get along with them like relatives normally would. But then I get treated like that. And here I was, finally thinking that I’d made some new friends, since I’ve been all alone this whole time. Quarter-demons have it pretty rough if we’re alone.” – Moroha
“I wonder who I am. I’m not a demon. I’m not a human. I’m not even a half-demon. There was no place for me, and I had nowhere to go. That’s why I always ran around by myself and went about making all sorts of noise. I didn’t know any other way to live. I feel like it’s pure luck that I’ve survived up to this point. And I have to keep living as an incomplete quarter-demon.” – Moroha
“Come on, let’s split the bounty three ways! We’re buddies who traveled together to the modern era. From here on, we can help each other out.” – Moroha
“Somehow before I knew it, these two were by my side. So…this is okay, right, Master Yawaragi?” – Moroha
“Damn you, you bunch of dummies! Your mama’s a human!” – Moroha
“With this rouge, I become Beniyasha, Destroyer of Lands. Tremble before the bloodthirsty dawn. Bear witness to your end if you so dare.” – Moroha
“This world is full of the weak. But the truly weak, are the ones who couldn’t protect what they wanted to protect most. And that’s, that’s what you would call me. How could I be so weak?” – Towa Higurashi
“That isn’t true. It doesn’t matter what era you live in, the way that a girl feels is always the same.” – Towa Higurashi
“Setsuna, you saw a bit of what it’s like there. The peaceful world… and everyone in it! When I get back your dreams, I’m going back over there, because I promised Mei that. And that’s why I’ll risk my life, but I won’t take other people’s lives away.” – Towa Higurashi
“I’ve decided to return to the Feudal Era. If Setsuna and Moroha are from the Feudal era, then the forest I grew up in would also be there. That means I’ve been raised here but was born in the Feudal Era. I only have gratitude for Papa Sōta for raising someone like me.” – Towa Higurashi
“I’m always the one being saved. Even though I’m the older sister.” – Towa Higurashi
“Even if we’ve never met him, Sesshōmaru is our father, right? Don’t ask his daughters to do something like that!” – Towa Higurashi
“Towa and Setsuna, between us half-demon twins, two worlds exist at the same time; Human and Demon, Feudal Era and Present Day, Peace and War, Joy and Sorrow, Dreams and Reality, Now and Forever, and finally Love and Hate. A Feudal fairytale, Yashahime. We’ll keep moving forward, overcoming the hurdles of destiny.” – Towa Higurashi
“Setsuna! Setsuna, calm down. Please! It’s me, Setsuna! It’s Towa! Get it together, Setsuna! Setsuna, please hear me. I’m right here, Setsuna! I’m here…Your older sister is right here!” – Towa Higurashi
“No! I need to defeat Homura no matter what! He’s the one who tore me and Setsuna apart!” – Towa Higurashi
“I wonder it is I’m feeling… I don’t feel this way when Papa Sōta hugs me.” – Towa Higurashi“If you’re doing gags, I think it’s important to have characters who are as strong-willed and impactful as possible.” – Akira Toriyama
“There was a manga boom, so I read ‘Astro Boy,’ ‘Osomatsu-kun,’ and such. But what influenced me the most were things like ‘Popeye’ and Disney animation.” – Akira Toriyama
“The women I draw all have the same sort of personality. I can’t draw gentle girls; I only know how to draw ones who are strong-willed.” – Akira Toriyama
“I really like the story of Bardock, Goku’s father. It’s quite dramatic and the kind of story I absolutely wouldn’t draw if it were me. It was like watching a different kind of ‘Dragon Ball’ in a good way, so I thought it was nice.” – Akira Toriyama
“If you want to depict something exactly the way it is, it takes a tremendous amount of time. If you don’t get the details right, the inaccuracies will accumulate somewhere.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’m flying by the seat of my pants, never creating with a thought to what’s up ahead!” – Akira Toriyama
“I say that I’ve never been late with a manuscript, but I don’t mean to be arrogant; it’s that I simply want to get it done as soon as possible so I can be set free.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’m a lazy person, but if I’m not absent-mindedly doing something, I can’t really relax. I can’t just veg out.” – Akira Toriyama
“The method of producing comics in Japan is very hectic, but it’s also rewarding because it’s possible to do both the story and art all by yourself.” – Akira Toriyama
“After graduating from high school, I worked at an advertising agency as a designer. After I left, I spent a year doing nothing in particular. At age 23, I drew my first comic.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’m entirely of the mindset that when it comes to books, they’ve got to be paper.” – Akira Toriyama
“Basically with everything, I choose my criteria based on what can be easy. If I made the real world the setting, I’d have to draw looking at reference materials for stuff like buildings and vehicles. When you do that, people complain even if it’s just a little bit off.” – Akira Toriyama
“Son Goku from ‘Dragon Ball’ doesn’t fight for the sake of others but because he wants to fight against strong guys. So once ‘Dragon Ball’ got animated, at any rate, I’ve always been dissatisfied with the ‘righteous hero’-type portrayal they gave him.” – Akira Toriyama
“I love girls, whether they wear glasses or not!” – Akira Toriyama
“Inside me, ‘Dragon Ball’ became a thing of the past, but later, I got upset at the live-action film, revised the script for the anime film, and complained about the quality of the TV anime. I guess, at some point, it became a work that I like so much that I can’t leave it alone.” – Akira Toriyama
“Since I’m a contrarian, I don’t want to go along with what everyone else thinks.” – Akira Toriyama
“Awww, I was so shy about watching my own work broadcast on TV.” – Akira Toriyama
“I was a mischievous child. I was also on the tall side.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’m not good at doing the same thing over and over again.” – Akira Toriyama
“I felt that working at an office from the early morning was impossible for me. Anyway, I wanted to be free from that lifestyle as soon as possible. I wanted to take it easy.” – Akira Toriyama
“I would often draw in my sleep. That alone made for twice the work… I couldn’t use the weird stuff I drew while dozing off, so I’d end up having to draw it all over again.” – Akira Toriyama
“I like efficient people. I’m pretty impatient, so I can’t stand people who putter around.” – Akira Toriyama
“I guess I like Piccolo the most after all. Out of all the enemies, Piccolo Daimao is the one I like most, and even after that, I like Piccolo the most.” – Akira Toriyama
“In spite of being so absorbed in comics when I was in primary school, for whatever reason, I stopped reading them that much once I started junior high. I think it’s probably because I got caught up in movies and TV.” – Akira Toriyama
“It’s been a habit of mine since childhood to always be looking around. When I go shopping, I have more fun observing the town than shopping.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’m just a manga artist, so I can’t stand being scrutinized.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’m always impressed with the work of animators. You have to be able to draw the scenes in between movements. I’m impressed with the way they can do that – I don’t think I could.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’ve been really frugal with money since way back, so I can’t buy something if it’s too expensive. I’m not that brave.” – Akira Toriyama
“I’d want to be born once more as myself, but more talented.” – Akira Toriyama“When I draw the scene that I’d been dreaming about or had always wanted to draw, that is the time that I’m happiest.” – Tite Kubo
“For me, life and death are very important themes. There is no life without death. That’s why it’s very important to me.” – Tite Kubo
“I’ve always wanted to be a manga-ka, so I’m doing what I love.” – Tite Kubo
“I have three assistants, but there isn’t a head assistant. All the important drawings I do myself. Every single character is also done by me.” – Tite Kubo
“The hardest thing about being a manga-ka is that it’s a weekly thing.” – Tite Kubo
“If it’s me, it would be a waste not to dance no matter what.” – Tite Kubo
“The message is that if you believe in what you create, it’s enjoyable and people will follow. The talented mangaka should know that; otherwise, no one would read or enjoy it. So believe in yourself. Believing in yourself is important.” – Tite Kubo
“In Japan, artists and fans are rather far apart from each other.” – Tite Kubo“I’m going to heal this corrupt world and go back to before I met you.” – Keyaru
“In my first go at life, I was a healer… Exactly as the name implies, I revive and heal the injured. However, there was a fatal drawback to healing. I see all the experiences of the people I heal stream in front of me in an instant. There was unimaginable fear and suffering, things that couldn’t be endured with a sane mind. Truthfully, I ran away countless times because I didn’t want to use my healing powers. But no matter how many times I escaped, I always ended up getting caught again.”  – Keyaru
“I’ll be able to repay you for raising me as If I were really your only child.” – Keyaru
“How about we have some brutal, gruesome, merciless fun, until you’re begging me for death.” – Keyaru
“The woman who took everything from me. She’s the reason I know what it’s like in hell. The target of my revenge.” – Keyaru
“Even I had come to the conclusion that the only ability of a healer is to heal. That’s why I was continuously exploited. Even If I had realized my mistake, my life was already over. I’m going to redo it all, so I can have the future I desire.” – Keyaru
“I was made into a heavy addict, and conditioned to use my healing for those drugs. They kept using me and treating me like livestock.” – Keyaru
“The weaker Keyaru no longer exists. I have been reborn. My name is Keyaruga. I will redo my life how I want it. I am strongest healer.” – Keyaru
“I am a pacifist; as long as you don’t do harm, I won’t come at you first. However, the moment you’ve become my enemy, there’s no forgiveness.” – Keyaru
“Even If It all disappears, I will never forget this pain. The despair of losing myself… The anguish. All of it carved away at my soul. Even if time is rewound and I lose my memories… those will never disappear!” – Keyaru
“I knew the imperial captial itself was filthy in many ways. The capital was created when they burned the village of the indigenous demi-humans that lived here to the ground, stole their lands, and made the survivors into slaves.” – Keyaru
“I can’t wait to hear how you’ll address me when I redo this world.” – Keyaru
“That dream… I had it again.” – Keyaru
“This time around, I’m going to take it all from that woman. I’m going to take everything from Flare!” – Keyaru
“You really think I’d heal someone like you? Die, you disgusting piece of trash.” – Keyaru
“It’s like there’s always a voice I can hear that comes from deep inside me.” – Keyaru
“This power was brought about by my actions as well as the side effects of healing. I relived the experiences of countless others, imitated their techniques, and made them my own.” – Keyaru
“Your intensely despised, smelly, dirty, adorable doggie Keyaru is here to play!” – Keyaru
“Hey, dimwit. Get over here and heal her! We’re all out of elixir. Healing’s all you’re good for so hurry up and get to it! We only kept you alive so we could use you for healing, you know.” – Blade
“Keyaru, are you okay? Was it that dream again?” – Anna
“Hey, do you remember this? When you were little, you said “I’m going to become a hero and save the entire village.” – Anna
“Humans. Do you intend to take it all from us, from the land of our dead to the only place those of us who are left can rest?” – Eve Reese
“Humans, witness the power of the demon lord!” – Eve Reese
“I see, so this is the end for me too. How upsetting that I couldn’t protect it…” – Eve Reese
“I have come here today to meet the new hero who has come into this world.” – Flare Arlgrande Jioral
“We shall work together and save the world from the menace of the demon lord.” – Flare Arlgrande Jioral”
“Use whatever you must, whether a drug or brainwashing. Make it so he is useful to use, so he can heal in battle. Make it happen, even if it destroys him.” – Flare Arlgrande Jioral
“Go on, beg! Good. You are very smart for a dog.” – Flare Arlgrande Jioral
“Goodness, you are a disgraceful little cur. I’ll give you your drug now.” – Flare Arlgrande Jioral
“With this money we can make a modest living for our entire lives.” – Freya

“A miracle. It’s a miracle! Now I can fight once more. Thank you, Keyaru!” – Kureha Clyret
“Thank you for allowing me to wield the sword again. I will never forget this act of kindness. I, the great swordsman Kureha Clyret, will use all of my ability to return this favor to you in due time.” – Kureha Clyret
“I can’t allow you to bring disgrace upon the name of our Krylet family sword.” – Kureha Clyret

“There’s supposed to be a cap on magic power, even if you work at it.” – Rudeus Greyrat
“I have fallen in love with a man. No, I wonder if he’s really a man. That’s it. That is the question. Is Fitts-senpai a man or a woman? Depending on the answer to that, I would know whether I am homosexual or straight. Since it seems to be the cure for my illness, I don’t really care which one he is. Either man or woman is okay, but I’d prefer woman.” – Rudeus Greyrat
“I shouldn’t discount the possibility that I’m unique.” – Rudeus Greyrat
“If I ever see her again, I’ll get her to let me lick her feet.” – Rudeus Greyrat

“10 years have passed since the founding of Anima City, yet the rift between humans and beastmen remain as wide as ever. Even so, this city continues to be a place of respite for beastmen.

“Alchemy: The science of understanding the structure of matter, breaking it down, then reconstructing it as something else. It can even make gold from lead. But alchemy is a science, so it must follow the natural laws: To create, something of equal value must be lost. This is the principle of Equivalent Exchange. But on that night, I learned the value of some things can’t be measured on a simple scale.

We were wrong.” – Edward Elric

“This era is not so simple that you can put everything on your shoulders and be the only sacrifice. And, at the same time, one person’s happiness isn’t that simple, either.

There is no need for you to either become Buddha, or a murderer.” – Seijuro Hiko

But unfortunately I’m also not trash that can live happily without paying back his debts!” – Ichigo Kurosaki

“When I was at the brink of life and death, I used all of my will to survive. I drew upon a different power than that of self-sacrifice and mastered an ultimate technique. The will to live is stronger than anything else. That was the ray of light that my master risked his life to show me. As Hitokiri Battousai, I have committed so many crimes that I cannot possibly repent for them. That is why I had secretly believed that it didn’t matter when I died or was killed. However, now… even if I am formally punished or restrained. I will never lose the will to live.” – Kenshin Himura
“Hero of Justice? A world where no one is hurt?” Don’t be absurd. “Humanity” is the name for an animal that cannot find joy in life without sacrifice. The pretty lie that is “equality” is nonsense spouted by weaklings who cannot look upon the darkness. Nothing but an excuse to cover up life’s ugliness.” – Gilgamesh
“The peaceful world I’m fighting for is one where everyone has a smile on their face, not one where I have to pretend I didn’t see you make my friend cry. I don’t think that kind of peace is worth fighting for. And I don’t think it’s worth making sacrifices to achieve it.” – Emi Yusa
“Trunks, Bulma, I’m doing this for you. And yes, even for you, Kakarot.” – Vegeta

“That’s why for you, you have the right to be cruel to me. No matter how much you make me worry or how much danger you put me in, just as much as you like. But these are not enough “compensation”. Even if I have to sacrifice my left over life for you, I would not utter a word of complaint.” – Zero Kiryu
“Your so-called “self-sacrifice” only satisfies yourself. Do you think you can save people with it? You’re only protecting yourself! You don’t know the suffering endured by those left alive. With your childish actions, you’re only pushing the pain onto other people!” – Elliot Nightray
“Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war… Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They’re two sides of the same coin… to protect something… another must be sacrificed.” – Madara Uchiha
“I am the alienated, the ridiculed, the despised. No need to praise my name. No need to envy my body. I am the shadow under the radiance of heroic spirits. Birthed of the darkness of glorious legend. And so, I hate, I resent. Nourished by the sighs of the people precipitated within the darkness, people that curse the light. This is my disgrace. Because of her unsullied glory, I must forever be belittled. You are, the sacrifice. Good, give me more, your blood and flesh, your life. Let them ignite my hatred!!” – Berserker“I yearn for true gender equality. I have no patience for one who talks about female privilege when it suits them, and then complains about someone “not being a man” when it’s convenient.” – Kazuma Satou

“To my teacher at school. I’m currently learning in a parallel world… The workings of its society, what it is to be human, and what it means to be alive. It makes me grateful that all the wonderful events transpiring here make me grow as a person. I’m so grateful, it makes me tear up. There isn’t a single night I haven’t soaked my pillow in tears. Uh, I mean that in a good way. A good way, okay?” – Kazuma Satou
“How does it feel to get dragged away with the guy you treated like a total idiot?” – Kazuma Satou
“You’ve been designated as the one thing I’ll be bringing along, so if you’re a goddess, use your godly powers or whatever to make my life as easy as possible!” – Kazuma Satou

“This isn’t how I imagined life in a parallel world would be.” – Kazuma Satou

“No… this is wrong! Didn’t I fall into hell? This can’t be hell! Surrendering my body to the devil, I should have become a wrinkled hag! My hair should be full of hateful snakes, my skin should be the color of a vile frog’s! And my blood should be burning with the jet black flames of my grudge..! A lie. This form, it’s a lie! I’ve been tricked! I wanted to become a terrifying woman, one that just a look from, would send anyone running. I have to be such a woman! I don’t want to forget my anger and hate!”
“Children’s minds are immature. They do not possess a firm resolve and the strength to turn their misery to anger. Confronted with a cruel fate, they were not provided with the choice of having a strong will. Moreover, as they have not lived through and comprehended life, ideals such as honor and hope are yet to be completely nurtured in them. Therefore, in moments of despair, children are more prone than adults to seal away their own mind, lock up their own heart. Because they have not tasted the joy of life they can afford to discard. Because they have not understood the meaning of future, they can sink into despair.” – Matou Kariya
“Sorry about this, young lady, but not being able to verbalize might be a lucky break for you in a way. People can waste an awful lot of energy by putting sadness into words. Or maybe joy into words. And then of course, there’s putting anger into words. And the words can double when it comes to fear or pain. In that sense, being so afraid that you can’t find any words may save your life. Being unable to speak in extreme stress, in a body that is obligated to control energy consumption, is an act of, OH, I don’t know, maybe, self defense? Oh boy, I went and said a thing of actual intelligence there. Time to show me some love, boys!” – Graham Specter
“Don’t let yourself be blinded by fear or anger. Everything is only as it is.” – Nui

“It’s still a form of love. To those with the emotion of love, acts of rebelling, anger, cursing, fighting, and killing do not work in contradiction to that emotion. Rather, too strong a love could quicken them. What the other wishes is not all there is to love.” – Khamsin
“Revenge is a rite that restores one’s spirit after it has been ravaged by the anger and hatred of loss. That is the only way to heal one’s soul and stand up again to face reality. That is the only way we can have a tomorrow.” – Yao Ro Dushi
“A scar indicates that something is missing. You lost something important, and there’s a hole in your heart. Having that empty hole can lead to anger, hate, despair, or… it can make you reach for the sky.” – Fuuko Karasaki
“Love is never without trials and tribulations–precisely because of that, there’s bitterness. What do you think? The feelings from liking someone… cannot be satisfied by your own efforts alone. It’s not the same as simple anger or sadness. One-sidedly declaring your feelings… this doesn’t bring satisfaction. Only when the other person feels the same way… Only when two hearts love each other is fulfillment achieved.” – Kamiya Kiyousuke
“It’s not just grief. There are as many emotions as there are people. The fragility of someone who lets their anger get the best of them… The strength to overcome fear because of love… You can’t comprehend anything about them.” – Chiyuki
“What does it take to end a war? Well, if both sides wish for peace and set aside their hatred… No. Warfare is nothing but a means of negotiation between states. Wars break out even when there is no hatred. Territory, resources, or interests that you are determined to own. Ideology, religion, pride. Wars are fought over those objectives all the time. Meaning that when those objectives are met, the war will end. That, or the war will end when the human cost outweighs the gains. Anger and hatred are only tools to tilt a war in your favor. I’m not interested in those emotions. So I wouldn’t hate anyone just because they’re Martian.” – Idaho Kaizuka

“If I hadn’t met you, I never would have realized what kind of person I am. I would have grown into an apathetic, clueless, obedient adult. However, after spending time with you, in tears, laughter, and anger, I now know that I have all these emotions inside me, too. And that makes me proud. I’m glad to have known you.” – Shion
“Look, everyone! This is what hatred looks like! This is what it does when it catches hold of you! It’s eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me! Fear and anger only make it grow faster!” – Prince Ashitaka
“You never thought to kill, or fight for revenge. Only to test your limits, and to push yourself beyond them, to become the strongest you could possibly be. How can a Saiyan fight like that, and at the same time be so gentle that he wouldn’t hurt a fly? It makes me angry just thinking about it. But perhaps it is my anger that has made me blind to the truth for so long. I see it now. This day has made it all too clear. You’re better than me, Kakarot. You are the best.” – Vegeta
” I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him. But… I couldn’t. I don’t know if it’s because I’m too weak to do it, or if it’s because I’m strong enough not to.” – Katara

“We all face the same direction, and we all work hard. Otherwise there’s no point. Do we have to work hard, while we get angry at the people who don’t care.” – Katou Hazuki
“Half breed or full breed, to me it don’t matter. But when you insult my mother, that’s when I get angry. For her sake then if for nothing else… I’m gonna make you pay!” – Inuyasha

“You just want women to give you pleasure. You just like the excitement of the risk of being found out. If you want excitement that bad, then shall I back you into a corner? Do you want me to tell your wife and tear apart your family? Do you want me to tell the school and have you disciplined? I’m not even the first student you’ve touched am I? You’re trash.” – Satou Matsuzaka
“I can’t go on like this. I’ll go crazy!” – Satou Matsuzaka
“You taught that kid the wrong idea about love. That’s why you have a responsibility to pay me back. A responsibility to help me. Take responsibility for doing this to me.” – Satou Matsuzaka
“I didn’t know…what warmth felt like. What kindness was. And more than anything else… I couldn’t understand what love was. It’s all thanks to Shio-chan. It’s because Shio-chan took my hand that one time. Shio-chan led me. I learned what happiness meant for the first time in my life. I never understood love before. But Shio-chan is the one who taught me what love means. I see! This is an even deeper feeling for Shio-chan…. I… finally…. Shio-chan, I hope you still love me when we’re reborn. I’m sorry…and thanks.” – Satou Matsuzaka

“It’s sweet…it’s sweet. I have to protect this life. This is where I belong. I’m going to protect [Shio] no matter what!” – Satou Matsuzaka
“I’m not going to criticize your love. But you’re still a kid. A kid who can’t take responsibility for herself. You want to overstep your bounds? Do it once you’ve grown up.” – Satou’s Aunt
“That’s right. You’re completely dependant on adults, after all. You sponge off and cling onto them to live. That’s how it works Satou Chan. You can’t pursue love alone, that’s the reality of things.” – Satou’s Aunt
“Don’t worry, Satou Chan. You’ll grow up someday. You’ll grow into a dirty adult in no time. So, keep acting like an innocent child. Even if you can’t get what you want, you can still do your best. That’s all you can do. You’re just a cute kid.” – Satou’s Aunt

It’s the truth. I’ve honestly never tried so hard at anything in my life! Because I loved this place… Because it was so important to me! I was so desperate to get back. I was scared… I was so scared! I didn’t want those eyes looking at me like that again… And I hated myself so much for feeling that way!” – Natsuki Subaru
“Listen, where I’m from there’s a saying, “3 heads are better than 1.” Wait, is it 2 heads? Whatever, the point is, 3 heads, thinking together are harder to break than only 1 arrow. It means you should rely on those around you instead of thinking about stuff alone!” – Natsuki Subaru
“While we talk, look forward to making up for all the time you’ve wasted looking back! We can start by talking about tomorrow.

“With no need to work part-time, I got to enjoy an idyllic Otaku life. That said, I certainly wasn’t one of your so-called shut-ins. When I’d run out of money to spend, I’d go to the library to browse through my light novels. I was a completely run-of-the-mill Otaku leading a completely ordinary life… but it all changed when I picked up this book.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“I shall handle the waves my way then. Get off me already.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“This is what you wanted right? You can shove it up your a*s.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Because I’m the shield hero, because I’m weak they’re trying to knock me down to make themselves look better. Disgusting.” – Naofumi Iwatani

“I’ve never heard of a hero who abandons a child to run away.” – Naofumi Iwatani

“I’d rather have money than words.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Uh, I’m pretty sure a shield is more like armor than a weapon. And where’s the heroine, anyway? I don’t think it’s this princess. She seems kinda sl*tty.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“I have to grow stronger… along with the people who believe in me, and I’ll protect them, come what may!” – Naofumi Iwatani
“The shield’s role would be to thwart enemy attacks and defend the party, right? And while my life back home was devoid of romance, I might just meet the one here. It’ll be fine. I’ve been summoned to another world, after all. Even if I’m weak, things will work out. All right, I’m gonna give it my all!” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Didn’t I swear to protect Raphtalia, Filo, And all the villagers?” – Naofumi Iwatani
“You attack and I defend. That way, neither of us will die.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Listen Raphtalia. Take that thing out here and now. If you fight and make me stronger, we can fend off the waves of Catastrophe and prevent that tragedy from reoccurring. Your parents won’t ever come back. But we can prevent other kids from going through what you did. And all I’m capable of is making sure you can fight as best as you can.” – Naofumi Iwatani“If it looks like I stand no chance I’ll run away and think up a new plan, but otherwise, I should see how strong it is with my own eyes, right?” – Rimuru Tempest

“Humans live with groups. If you mess with them, they could retaliate in a big way. And if they came after us in earnest, I doubt we could handle them. Besides, getting along benefits us in lots of ways, anyway.” – Rimuru Tempest
“Well, you’ve all gotten stronger by evolving, right? It means you shouldn’t let that get to your head and push weaker races around. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re better than them. You don’t want them getting stronger themselves and retaliating someday, do you?” – Rimuru Tempest
“No one died, so we’ll say it’s all good.” – Rimuru Tempest
“The Lizardmen will share a clean water resource and fish, the Goblins will offer places to live, and our town will give them processed goods. And in return, the Orcs will contribute labor. All the races of the Great Forest of Jura will form an alliance and build a mutually cooperative relationship. It’d be really cool if we could create a nation where all races could coexist!” – Rimuru Tempest
“To everyone who went against us, we will bare our fangs and retaliate. To everyone who lends their hands to us, we will grant our blessing to them. To our opponents, we will do to them what they have done to us. In the future, I hope that we can be linked in a friendship one day.” – Rimuru Tempest
“In this world, it’s eat or be eaten.” – Rimuru Tempest

Shizu-san, this is for the best, right?” – Rimuru Tempest“The pain of getting hit, the frustration of loosing, the joy of winning, all of that.

“I won’t run, I will stand and look ahead to what I must do, I must face the fear, I won’t let it control me anymore, I will use my heart that holds my courage and my bravery to move me forward to what I must do.” – Gray Fullbuster
“It’s not the goodbyes that hurt, it’s the flashbacks that follow.” – Gray Fullbuster
“There’s no need to change the past. Because of the past we are who we are now. Every second, every action from then is linked to us here and now.” – Gray Fullbuster
“Sadness is just another wall that blocks you from moving on. I know it’s hard to get past it, but you got to break through.” – Gray Fullbuster

He’s clueless when it comes to recreational activities. He can’t do anything besides escape from prison the idiot. But.. He understands us… More than anyone else. He understands people. If you believe Jyugo…is only a monster…Then I think the one.. Who’s the real monster.” – Uno
“There’s more to a real man than just his good looks!” – Uno
“You’re such a gloomy Gus, aren’t you? You’re so gloomy, indecisive, and so pessimistic. You’re also dull, have bad handwriting, can’t learn, insensitive, weak, a slow runner, a poor talker, and a poor liar. You really can’t do anything other than break out of jail. Also you have short legs. But… that means you have lots of character traits, right? That’s all you need to know for now, don’t you think? If you don’t know something, we’ll teach you. We’re gonna make your life more fun. It doesn’t matter whether we’re in jail or hell. If we live happily, we win. So let’s take it slow and make sure you’ll enjoy tomorrow.” – Uno
“I’ve searched tirelessly in every prison I’ve been sent to. I’ve looked and looked and kept on looking – these damn black shackles which seem to constrain my very freedom, only he can remove. I’ve come this far neither of us has anywhere left to run. In Nanba Prison, this is the end of the line.” – Jyugo
“He doesn’t seem like the kind of person who would break a promise to me. That guy is simple-minded and stupidly honest to a fault. He’s always getting lost, breaking down walls, running in the hallways, and eating tons of rice. Even I get totally pissed off at him. But he never gives up once he decides to do something. Setting aside his methods, Yamato always does his work in his own way…I think. So there’s no way he’d break a promise or do things half-way… I think. Well, this is all just kinda my opinion, anyway.” – Jyugo
“These, I can never remove even if I want to. These ‘black shackles’ were placed on me at one of my old prisons while I was asleep, but no one at that place knew anything about these cuffs – just a shackle with no chain links. Some stranger from out of nowhere put them on me. I’ve tried everything, but to no avail… and no matter how many how many prison guards or researchers attempt to remove them, its impossible. No one has a clue.” – Jyugo
“Jail-breaking is my one and only hobby and skill.” – Jyugo
“Are you gonna threaten me right until the very end? Hajime… you said it yourself, right? Nothing will change by running away. Yet again, I’m in your care.” – Jyugo
“Then go get her like you’re supposed to today. That’s what you call ‘taking responsibility’, right? Whether she hates you or not, you’re still her dad. I haven’t got any fond memories of my old man, see. But I think your kid’s pretty blessed just to have you trying so hard for her sake. She probably just hasn’t noticed it yet. Your efforts, I mean.” – Rock
“Since that guy can’t do anything, I can do something. I’m really happy about that, you see. Jyugo was the one who first gave me “Freedom”. He changed my life. That’s why I owe him a lifetime’s debt of gratitude. I don’t know what I can do or what I can give to him, but I want to give him everything I can. I want to do whatever I can to make sure he’s content.” – Rock
“I mean, that guy can’t do anything but escape from prison, actually, on the contrary, he doesn’t do anything but that. That’s why we have to handle everything somehow afterwards.” – Rock

“Don’t you think it would be fun to find out more about the feelings of others a bit more, too? Like how they think and feel about you. Or what you can do to make them happy or let them have fun. If you do that you can know more about both them and yourself, right?” – Trois

“I’m sorry, but a respectful warrior doesn’t dishonour his enemy by holding back.” – Liang
“At the time, I interpreted his “freedom” as something related to the feeling of spaciousness after getting “outside”. But I was wrong. I felt it this time my arms and legs were bound and perhaps due to the drugs, I couldn’t move or speak. The little I could see dimly reflected in my view became everything. I couldn’t help but feel that I was a very “weak” and “powerless” existence then. For what purpose did I train my fists every day despite being a criminal? Who did I think to approach, to aim for? Everything was for the sake of meeting the expectations of that person, who could be called my “teacher”. And yet…” – Liang
“You have to trust yourself, you have great strength Jyugo.” – Liang
“I think “freedom” for me is being able to do something or being able to accomplish something. You were the one who gave me that chance. Jyugo, you have my thanks.” – Liang
“Freed hands and legs that can walk. Removed cuffs and a door thrown open. A sight I never thought would come true is spread out before my eyes. The “freedom” Rock talked about. I finally understand what it means.” – Liang
“The truth is, I’ve been watching but I still can’t quite understand. It’s not like he’s cunning or physically. I heard he was simply an escaped prisoner, but even so I can’t see him as a criminal at all.” – Liang
“I didn’t want to take such a dangerous bet. I want you to at least take care of yourselves. We’re finally at a place where we can start over, after all.” – Qi
“People who live honest lives lose out. People who have a dirty way of life win. I was always the latter, so this reality pierced deep.

I don’t think I can lead an honest life at this point, but I thought I wanted to do something, that it was fine even if it was just self-satisfaction. No matter what kind of thing it is, it definitely has a use. I wanted to prove that by myself.” – Qi

“I will die before I let you touch him!” – Tsunade
“One of the Legendary Sannin taking on a snot-nosed Genin… I oughta be ashamed of myself.” – Tsunade
“Jiraiya, are you the one who taught him the Rasengan? Are you acting like a teacher by teaching him something he can’t master? Don’t give him any ideas! That’s why this kid likes to daydream that he’s going to become Hokage someday.” – Tsunade
“People become stronger because they have things they cannot forget. That’s what you call growth.” – Tsunade“It is a place where every year shinobi are born, raised, grow old, fight, and die to protect their home. These people are precious to me. We share a home, we share a life, and though we may not share ties of blood, they are precious to me. They are my family. And if I do fall, you still will fail. I am only one of a long line.

If blue is the chakra, then yellow is the seal, and green is the jutsu… Just as there is no end to the variety of colors, there are so many thousands…tens of thousands of jutsu in the world as well.

“A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home.” – Jiraiya
“You’re wrong, that’s not what makes a shinobi. You never did get it, a real ninja is one who endures no matter what gets thrown at him… Let me explain something to you, there is only one thing that matters if you are a shinobi, and it isn’t the number of jutsu you possess. All you do need, is the guts to never give up.” – Jiraiya
“When people get hurt, they learn to hate… When people hurt others, they become hated and racked with guilt. But knowing that pain allows people to be kind. Pain allows people to grow… and how you grow is up to you.” – Jiraiya

I realized that finding our purpose IS the meaning. That’s why we’re here. And the ones who find it… They’re the only ones who are truly free.” – Kimimaro
“Humans… Do humans have a purpose when they are born? I have been wondering recently. Because they are born, do they have an important duty? The meaning of being born… For humans to find that answer… It is the one freedom God gave them.” – Kimimaro“Is there… somebody precious to you?” – Haku

“I want to make his dreams come true.” – Haku
“I am of no more use as his tool. Please, kill me.” – Haku
“When people are protecting something truly precious to them. They truly can become…as strong as they need to be!” – Haku
“Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing… that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don’t you see? It’s an empty existence, to go on living… alone and unloved… when defeat’s already cost you your dream!” – Haku
“It is only through the eyes of others that our lives have any meaning.” – Haku“Love breeds sacrifice… which in turn breeds hatred. Then you can know pain.” – Pain
“Learn to embrace the fear of feeling about what it’s like to contemplate what it is to know true pain. Because when I had nothing and no one – I always had Pain.” – Pain
“We are but men, drawn to act in the name of revenge that we deem to be justice. But… if there is justice in revenge then that same justice will breed only more revenge… and trigger a cycle of hatred.” – Pain
“How can you say that you will never change? That you will not change, no matter how great the pain you face? Can you continue believing in yourself forever? Can you guarantee it? Can you have such faith in yourself?!” – Pain
“Justice comes from vengeance, but that justice only breeds more vengeance.” – Pain
“Because of the existence of love – sacrifice is born. As well as hate. Then one comprehends… one knows PAIN.” – Pain
“Pain is the way to bring peace.” – Pain
“You think you’re the only ones who matter. You think you can put off death. But that peace made you foolish and thoughtless. If you kill someone, someone else will kill you… this hatred binds us together.” – Pain

“Feel pain, think about pain, accept pain, know pain… Shinra Tensei!” – Pain
“Do you understand pain a little now? If you don’t share someone’s pain, you can never understand them. But just because you understand them doesn’t mean you can come to an agreement. That’s the truth.” – Pain
“Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because. No matter how pathetic the reason, it’s enough to start a war.” – Pain
“Even innocent foolish children will grow up in the face of pain, until their thoughts and beliefs are the same as their doubts.” – Pain
“Just by living, people hurt others without even realizing it. So long as humanity exists, hate will also exist. There is no peace in this cursed world. War is just a crime paid for by the pain of the defeated.” – Pain
“People are stupid. If I don’t do this, there will be no peace. Eventually, time will pass and the pain will heal. Eventually, checkmate’s power will weaken and people will begin fighting again. This time, they will use the weapon themselves and once more know true pain. And for the short time, peace will come again. It will give birth to short period of peace within this endless chain of hatred. That’s my wish.” – Pain
“Love is the reason why there is pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?” – Pain“The curse represents a mark of the bird in a cage… It is… the symbol of being tied down to an inescapable destiny.” – Neji Hyuga

“You are the strongest enemy I have ever fought.” – Neji Hyuga
“People share only one common fate… death.” – Neji Hyuga
“The heavens will not allow a pawn who can only seek victory at the cost of himself to advance…” – Neji Hyuga
“Because Naruto… you saved me from the darkness.” – Neji Hyuga
“There’s no method but death to escape this horrible curse.” – Neji Hyuga
“Hinata… this is the unalterable difference in strength… the distinction that separates the elite from the failure. This is the unchangeable reality. From the moment you said you wouldn’t run, your defeat was inevitable. The only possible outcome was your present despair… Withdraw!” – Neji Hyuga
“Do you understand now? You have no way of beating me!” – Neji Hyuga
“He’s so childish. He acts like a seven-year-old!” – Neji Hyuga
“As usual, I can’t keep up with their craziness.” – Neji Hyuga
“Once a failure, always a failure. You can’t change that.” – Neji Hyuga
“All this time I’ve been called a genius, so I cannot lose.” – Neji Hyuga
“So you’re not going to withdraw? Then don’t blame me for what happens to you.” – Neji Hyuga
“Naruto… Sometimes, your eyes are even better than mine.” – Neji Hyuga
“The difference between stupidity and genius, is that genius has its limits.” – Neji Hyuga
“Father, is a person’s destiny a thing like a cloud flowing with an inescapable flow? Or can a person choose the flow he wishes… I still don’t know the answer to this. Either way the destination may be the same in the end. However by choosing to live like the latter, a person can live and strive towards a goal. And in this match I have finally understood those who have that are truly strong. Father, I have but one goal, I want to become stronger… Enough not to lose to anyone… That’s how I feel. Father, the birds are flying freely today… They look so happy.” – Neji Hyuga

“I’m not running away and I’m not giving up. I will save this child.” – Tenten
“I won’t let that happen. You’re not getting off that easy. No way! The people you and Raiga killed, they all wanted to live but you didn’t leave them that choice! You decided for them! Well you don’t get to decide this time, ok?! You’re gonna live and you’re going to take some responsibility for all those people’s lives you cut short!” – Tenten
“I can’t stand weak and indecisive people!” – Tenten
“You’re gonna fight Sasuke alone? And you think all of us are just gonna stand here and let you?!” – Tenten
“The weaker you are the louder you bark.” – Tenten
“Amazing… The brilliance of the blade… the design. They’re all beautiful! I want to take them all home!” – Tenten
“Let’s just say I don’t like being kept in the dark!” – Tenten
“It’s not because they’re girls you know, Neji. It’s just that those two are using kid gloves. It doesn’t matter if you’re a man or woman in battle.” – Tenten
“Three members of Team Guy specializes in Close-Contact battles so I often render aid from the distance. I don’t mind providing back up, but I was hoping to find new ninja tools that would enable me to fight on the front lines.” – Tenten“Life is like a pencil that will surely run out, but will leave the beautiful writing of life.” – Nami
“Everyone is expecting help from you, but you come here and don’t think about doing anything to help those people?” – Nami
“Hopes for the future..? Yes. However, getting there with you…is not much different than being alone..! What good is the treasure if I’m alone? After sharing so much of our dreams. Instead of sacrificing them and leaving with you I would rather… HAVE NOTHING AT ALL!” – Nami
“I’m the smartest member in the Straw Hat group.” – Nami
“I’ll have mapped out the entire world!” – Nami
“Why? The work that the marines should be doing now…there are many things that you have to take care of. Don’t know that Arlong has killed many people and destroyed many villages? Under his control, everyone was treated like a slave! And you didn’t do a single thing about that!! And now you just want to find the treasure of one thief? Is this a real government?” – Nami
“Just one more time and everything will be the same. Everything will come back to me. And I will be free from Arlong. Bellemere-san. Finally, I can laugh with all my heart.” – Nami
“It’s never ending with those idiots. HEY! Lay off the sob stories! You know how dangerous this island is! Let’s not give it any help in killing us!” – Nami
“Don’t touch Bellemere-san’s orange with your dirty hands! I won’t give that money to you. That money is…” – Nami“A dropout will beat a genius through hard work.” – Rock Lee
“If you believe in your dreams, I will prove to you, that you can achieve your dreams just by working hard.” – Rock Lee

“I won’t let you lay another finger on Naruto!” – Hinata Hyuga

“On that day, you taught me that solitude is painful! I understand that so well right now. I have family, and I have friends but if you’re gone… To me… It will be the same as being alone.” – Sakura Haruno
“Naruto’s here because he’s made up his mind. My resolve is nothing compared to his now! I’m supposed to be a ninja, but all I’ve ever done is lean on him and cry… I was supposed to change that… I came here and I thought I was ready. But I can’t do anything… I can’t say anything. The only thing that remains for me… is to believe in them!” – Sakura Haruno
“A smile is the easiest way out of a difficult situation.” – Sakura Haruno

“I… Sasuke… I… I thought I could do this.” – Sakura Haruno
“Same as always… I can only do the dumbest of things for Naruto.” – Sakura Haruno
“It’s always like this. The only things I can ever do for Naruto are the little things anyone could do…” – Sakura Haruno

“Don’t worry, this will be over in five seconds.” – Sasuke Uchiha
“Naruto… I know you’re special but, I AM MORE SPECIAL THAN YOU!” – Sasuke Uchiha
“If you think I’m just a foolish kid ruled by his emotions, that’s fine. Following Itachi’s path would be childish, the whispering of fools who don’t know hatred. If anyone else tries to ridicule the way I live, I’ll slaughter everyone they ever cared about. And then maybe they’ll understand what it’s like to taste… a little of my hatred.” – Sasuke Uchiha
“Tears and rain, fall down on my face, my body is unable to stay yet my heart is unwilling to leave.” – Sasuke Uchiha

You were on your own right from the beginning, what makes you think you know anything about it?! Huh?!

“If anyone else tries to ridicule the way I live, I’ll slaughter everyone they ever cared about. And then maybe they’ll understand what it’s like to taste… a little of my hatred.” – Sasuke Uchiha“My sister didn’t care about the world. Deep down, all she wanted… was to love you. You couldn’t be together, but she still wanted you. That was what led her down the road to possession. Yet, eight years ago, the world suddenly ended. Any adult who hadn’t gotten the vaccine in time died. The Four Horsemen of John appeared out of nowhere and began killing those who survived. Vampires, fearing the loss of their food source, took control of as many cities as they could. In response to that, someone somewhere called it Armageddon. They said that divine wrath was unleashed on humanity for the sins of overpopulation and overindulgence. Everyone believes that now.” – Shinoa Hiiragi

“This entire school is a training ground for the army. We keep demons in the basement. Any students who can tolerate the aura they emit without going mad are recruited. In other words, This ‘school’ is nothing more than one giant human experiment.

“The world’s in shambles, and we can’t trust a single adult still alive. Surrounded by enemies on all sides, here we squat in a men’s room like a gang of school-age delinquents. We paint quite the picture right now, don’t you think?” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“I see, I see! I’d expect nothing less from a daughter of the prestigious Sangu family. Not just anybody can stand around like a useless lump and still get promoted!” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Well, with your gear, Yuichiro… If you learn to use a few curses, you should be able to fill in that gap a little. However, once you are on level footing with a vampire, then what? Myself, Mitsu, Yoichi… We’re all stuck behind. We’ll be killed. That is why all of us need teamwork. Today’s encounter was an excellent lesson. We were even blessed to escape without casualties. And I am particularly happy that you, of all people, suggested a retreat. But most of all, I’m thankful that you saved my life. You are as protective of your friends as Lieutenant Colonel Guren thought.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Lemme see! Oh my! Is this what I think it is? It is! That legendary grade only achieved by the most special of students! Let’s show it to everybody!” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Monsters appeared suddenly and killed more people. Now, the human population has been reduced to a mere fraction of what it once was. Beyond those walls lie blasted wastelands and crumbling ruins overrun with monsters. This world of ours… no longer welcomes humanity. We of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army are bringing the remnants of humanity together to reproduce so that we can take over the world! Breed for us, civilians! Multiply! Make more babies for the sake of the Demon Army! Long live premarital and illicit relationships!” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“You have nothing to worry about, Lieutenant Colonel! Since I’m an adult, I know ignoring the whiny yipping of the weak, talentless losers is only the mature thing to do.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Getting the fullest out of your cursed gear requires copious study and training. The drugs are meant to make up for that which even the most devoted training can’t provide. But look at the world around us. We simply don’t have time for that. War has already begun.” – Shinoa Hiiragi

“What? Run away to somewhere both the vampires and the Demon Army won’t ever find us? Man, that brings back memories. Back then we were both desperate to run away from our world of vampires and slavery. So we escaped… Hoping and praying to find some paradise where we could live in peace… But all we found was this. We can’t run, Mika. There’s nowhere to run to. No matter where we go, all we’ll find is more humans and vampires.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Who cares about points? This is you’re family we’re talking about! If they die, then… they’re gone for good. You won’t ever see them again.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Whatever your reasons, if you hadn’t rescued me that day, I would’ve died. I do still feel like I owe you for that. So what I wanna know is… Am I actually useful to you? That’s all. I don’t care what you and that Hiiragi guy are fighting about. I don’t care what you’re after. All I want to know is, do you need me? If you do… Would you want Mika, too? He was in the same orphanage as me. If you do… If you think you could need Mika like you need me… Then, I’ll be your guinea pig or anything you want. I’ll do everything I can to help you with whatever you need. Just tell me how I can get Mika back!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya

“I don’t ever wanna say I survived because I left someone else to die ever again.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“You aren’t Mika. Mika would never tell me to get revenge. He was smart, but he was always stupidly nice to all of us. So who are you? How dare you pretend to be my family. I’ll kill you!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“My parents abandoned me!! I finally found a second family at my orphanage, but then they all got killed by vampires!! Anybody that I even start to like dies!! How am I supposed to find anything to protect anymore?” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“I can’t stand those blood-suckers looking at me like I’m livestock! What do they think we are? Pigs? Cows? Chickens? That’s why we’ve gotta start a revolution! You and me, Mika. We’ll both get stronger, and then we’ll go kill the vampire queen and turn this place into a human kingdom!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“That’s right. Humans will do anything for their family. Even if it means shamelessly lying or turning into a devil or demon. If that’s vile, then fear our depraved acts and keel over, vampires!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“I need power to get revenge. As long as it’s within my reach, I don’t care if it’s from a demon or a devil.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Quit trying to shoulder all our burdens by yourself!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Even if I have to use myself as bait, I’ll save her. I’m through living a life where people need to be left behind!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Every time I close my eyes, I see the same scene. I’m back in the underground world ruled by vampires… watching my family die. I’ll make them pay. I swear, someday I’m gonna make them pay. I’m gonna find those bloodsuckers… and kill them all.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Who needs some stupid ‘family’? I got sent here because my father tried to kill me. My mom kept ranting and raving about how I was demon spawn. She eventually went nuts and killed herself. So do you get it now? ‘Family’ doesn’t mean anything to me.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“What? Leave? Who do you think you’re talking to? I live only for revenge against those blood-sucking bastards. If I can’t kill monsters of this level, what use am I going to be?” – Yuichiro Hyakuya“A flower can’t choose the place where it blooms and a child can’t choose the parents he’s born to.” – Erza Scarlet
“But what’s important isn’t the Magic, it’s the heart of the wielder who uses it.” – Erza Scarlet

“Nine-Tails, you are merely a momentary life, a temporary existence of coalesced energy… energy that once was a single, ultimate form!

“Power is not will, it is the phenomenon of physically making things happen.” – Madara Uchiha

“I’d be lying if I said things are going according to my plan… but beggars can’t be choosers, right?” – Madara Uchiha

“You are a fool, Ichigo Kurosaki. You willingly seek to challenge an opponent so much more powerful than you that it strikes a primal fear into your being. Incomprehensible. If this is the work of the ‘heart’ that you people speak of, then it is because you possess this ‘heart’ that you humans bring hurt upon yourself, because you possess this ‘heart’ that you lose your lives.” – Ulquiorra Cifer
“When people are protecting something truly precious to them. They truly can become…as strong as they need to be!” – Haku
“Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing… that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don’t you see? It’s an empty existence, to go on living… alone and unloved… when defeat’s already cost you your dream!” – Haku
“Even innocent foolish children will grow up in the face of pain, until their thoughts and beliefs are the same as their doubts.” – Pain
“Love is the reason why there is pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?” – Pain

“Wherever there is hope, there is most definitely despair.” – Junko Enoshima
“Hope is harmony. A just heart, moving toward the light. That is all. Despair is hope’s polar opposite. It is messy and confusing. Despair swallows up love, hatred, and everything else. Because not knowing where you will end up is despair. Despair is what even you cannot predict. Only despair’s unpredictability will save you from a boring future.” – Junko Enoshima
“Over the course of several hundred years, I’ve seen many ages end, conflict between people, hatred, wicked hearts. I always have hope that the new age will purify all of that. How many times has it happened? People repeat themselves. They commit the same mistakes, over and over…. They haven’t survived, not in a true sense. The precious race called people has become extinct.” – Zeref Dragneel
“The world lies! Thou shalt not commit murder, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not cheat, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife. All of these are lies. Mere illusions and nothing more.” – Charles ZI Britannia
“All men are NOT created equal! Some are born smarter, or more beautiful, or with parents of greater status. Some, by contrast, are born of weak body or mind, or with few, if any, talents.

“A person is very strong when he seeks to protect something.” – Akihiko Kayaba“You see, I really hate the word “responsibility” saying something or doing something “it’s your responsibility” “take responsibility” making a “selection” always comes with “responsibility.” That’s why I abandoned “selection” therefore, I don’t have to bear any responsibility anymore.” – Kuruwa Kimiharu
“Life is all about “selection”. There’s no such thing as a life of being pushed around by circumstances or a life of doing as one is told. It is you who selected to be “swept along.” – Gin Kurobe

“In some ways, the more one thinks, the closer one feels to getting the answer…but in the end, it’s hard to tell what is really the safe answer. I started to dislike being like that at one point, and my motto is, “make quick decisions and act fast.” I choose the first answer that feels “right” to me.” – Shirasagi Yuki“People started growing crops because going hunting without knowing if you’d catch anything was a pain. People dug wells because going all the way to the river was a pain. Laziness is the mother of human progress.” – Ikta Solork

“I’ll give you some wise words, Shining Sleepless General. All heroes die of overwork.” – Ikta Solork
“If you think unconditional kindness is good, and any sort of kindness that comes with conditions is hypocrisy, you should reconsider. People can only achieve as much as the situation allows.” – Ikta Solork“A lie yields hope when you realize it’s a lie. On the other hand, when you feel that a cruel fact is reality, you fall into despair all the more.” – Miyazaki Ryuu
“I believe that love is much deeper than that. It’s much more irreversible. It exceeds just caring for each other and continues until both parties become entangled and inseparable. They combine to form a single concept. They become one. Neither of them must come apart. THAT’S LOVE.” – Hoshino Kazuki
“Life has no weight in itself; it’s a concept created by the observer that does not have a definite form. Essentially, life does not entail multiple instances but is just one massive wobbly lump. However, we tend to refer to the bodies that were formed out of that giant lump as “lives”. The essence of life is in all of us and can’t be “stolen” or “born.” As long as the essence of life exists, life does not decrease or increase, and it certainly won’t disappear.” – Hoshino Kazuki
“If I abandoned you, I would be released from this pain. I would live on. But before long, I would end up seeking you again, for all my actions are ultimately devoted to you and only you. All I want is to stay on target and walk straight ahead—ignoring the losses and opposition, and even the results. That’s all I can do. Some people might call it an obsession, others may deem it a miracle—but to me and many others, my driving rationale couldn’t be more obvious and natural. There are people who understand this and there are people who don’t, and I simply happen to belong to the first group. The only difference is whether they have noticed that they don’t need boxes to make their wishes come true, and what it means to fulfil a wish.” – Hoshino Kazuki
“My commitment to find you comes with great suffering. Not once have I thought it’s easy. For your sake, I laughed, cried, and yelled. Because of you, I destroyed my heart, my body, and the world. Still, I’m only really alive when I’m touching the fragment of you that I carry within me. Even if I don’t reach you in the end… Even if I know the horrible outcome that awaits me… I will keep searching for you, who dwells inside Maria. I’m going to vanish. Maybe I’m getting my just deserts for being too greedy with my wish. To be honest, part of me regrets that we met, but if I were to choose between a life in which we met and a life in which we didn’t, I would always pick the former.” – Hoshino Kazuki

“I no longer pay attention to other people’s skills. It doesn’t matter; at the end of the day, you can only do your best.” – Usui Haruaki
“Because I won’t die if I miss.” I can totally understand the words of that slugger. We won’t die just because our dreams and efforts prove futile, nor do we need to despair. We both faced much greater despair, so we aren’t afraid of the obstacles that lie before us. We can easily bet on a coin flip while others are too frightened to even pick heads or tails.” – Usui Haruaki
“You can’t cause a change without some courage and determination.” – Usui Haruaki
“There’s no despair that can’t be overcome by everyday life.” – Otonashi Maria

“I really do hate humans….I really do.” – Rachnera Arachnera
“Oh, wow – I can’t believe you bit through my thread! I guess that isn’t the only part of you that’s rock-hard!” – Rachnera Arachnera
“I’m just letting you know, I’m not telling you this because I want your pity! I’m just fed up with humans, that’s all! They tell lie after lie, only accepting people who are the same as they are! Humans are such hypocrites!” Rachnera Arachnera
“So you’re trying to accept everyone and their feelings, aren’t you? I think you already know this, but if you keep trying to do this “accepting” thing with everyone, you’re liable to be torn to bits.” – Rachnera Arachnera
“Now what am I going to do with you….you’re already making quite a ruckus.” – Rachnera Arachnera
“You get turned on by spider legs? You really are a pervert!” – Rachnera Arachnera
“Pretending to get along is just hypocritical. If you don’t like me, that’s fine. People are free to like and hate what they want.” – Rachnera Arachnera
“When I first came here…you know, we Lamias are shy about meeting new people. I’m half-snake… so I was worried that you’d be scared of me. But you weren’t bothered by my snake body. In fact you went out of your way for me. And accepted me with a smile.” – Miia
“I’m so jealous I could just moult!” – Miia
“Welcome home, Darling! What would you like to do first? Dinner? A bath? Or me?” – Miia
“Sheesh! And I thought I was cold-blooded!” – Miia
“On a date! On a date! I’m going on a date today! On a date today with my Darling!” – Miia
“I don’t need food. I can get nutrients from anything I can dissolve.” – Suu
“He doesn’t have any money for food, and five freeloaders just showed up and ate all of his shit, so he’s a little pissed about it.” – Suu“People who’ve had lots of failures talk about those failures as if to imply that if they have another life, they’ll be a big success. After facing all that hardship, they think they won’t mess up again. But they’re all – me included, of course – making a fundamental mistake. Failures know a lot about failure, sure. But knowing failure is completely different from knowing success. Fixing your mistakes doesn’t mean success takes their place – you’ve just got a point to start at, is all. That’s something failures don’t understand.” – Three Days Of Happiness
“There can be no going back once you come to love someone.” – Miyagi
“However happy or sad something is, you’ll soon forget it if you don’t get a chance to recall it. What people don’t realize is that they’ve forgotten about forgetting. If everyone really preserved the happiest memory from their past perfectly, they’d only be sadder living in their relatively hollow present. And if everyone preserved the worst memory from their past perfectly, well, they’d still be sad. Everyone just remembers what it’s inconvenient not to remember.” – Kusunoki
“You appearing before me was the best thing that’s ever happened in my life. The worst was when you left my sight. …And depending on your reply now, I might have a new best or worst.” – Kusunoki
“I don’t put much trust in words like “personality” or “disposition” or “character.” Those things all change depending on the situation. Looking at it in the long run, what changes people is what situations they get into. People put a lot of faith in consistency, but it’s something more superficial than most people think.” – Kusunoki
“I’d rather have my physical pain exceed my mental pain than the other way around. By hurting myself just enough, I could turn my attention to that.” – Kusunoki
“Re-explaining my memories through words made good memories easier to savor, and bad memories easier to accept.” – Kusunoki“Breaking a bond is every bit as painful as being physically torn apart. Can you endure that?” – Amamiya Yuuko
“A miracle never comes to those who seek it.” – Amamiya Yuuko
“No matter how important a person is, some day you will lose them. No matter how much you desire it, eternity is one thing you will never possess. It’s the time you do spend with that person that’s important, so that you can meet your parting without regret.” – Amamiya Yuuko
“Everyone has prayed to God at one point in time, even if they aren’t believers.” – Amamiya Yuuko
“Human beings are cruel. Even though it’s heartbreaking, I feel hungry. Even though it’s painful, I feel sleepy. And, even though it’s painful for me, I still eat and sleep peacefully. I can’t forgive myself, and hence it becomes even more painful.” – Asou Renji
“I want to break up while I can still say I love you.”  Chihiro Shindou
“To fulfill your dream, you need to have a dream first. You can have an image, a desire, or a wish of what you want to become. Don’t forget about it, and keep wishing for it. That’s the first step to fulfilling your dream.” – Kuze Shuichi
“It doesn’t matter what the essence of it is. The truth is what’s hidden inside.” – Hiro Hirono
“No matter how much you treasure them, both people and things will die someday. The bonds, the feelings, the memories, the hearts, and the lives. There’s nothing in this world that won’t die. There’s nothing that won’t break. Happiness is nothing more than a fabrication; a false mirage. That’s why… That’s why we should treasure them. So that we can face the farewell that’ll one day visit us without regret. Because it’ll break, it is precious. Let’s make it precious.” – Mizuki Hayama
“After all, lying for someone’s sake doesn’t make it a lie.” – Mizuki Hayama
“Besides, miracles don’t exist in this world. There are only inevitabilities and accidents, and what you’re going to do. That’s it.” – Himura Yuu
“Because she learned about happiness, she feels lonely for the first time. And because she knows unhappiness, she understands happiness for the first time.” – Himura Yuu
“This world revolves around two views on the same thing. In addition, it’s about laughable miseries.” – Himura Yuu“Once you have met someone, you never really forget them.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I get inspiration from my everyday life.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“You may not like what’s happening, but just accept it, and let’s try to live together. Even if you feel angry, let’s be patient and endure, let’s try to live together. I’ve realized that this is the only way forward.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Is someone different at age 18 or 60? I believe one stays the same.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“If you’re going to retire, retire early.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Logic is using the front part of the brain, that’s all. But you can’t make a film with logic. Or if you look at it differently, everybody can make a film with logic. But my way is to not use logic.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“In the past, humans hesitated when they took lives, even non-human lives. But society had changed, and they no longer felt that way. As humans grew stronger, I think that we became quite arrogant, losing the sorrow of ‘we have no other choice.’ I think that in the essence of human civilization, we have the desire to become rich without limit, by taking the lives of other creatures.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Humans have both the urge to create and destroy.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I don’t like games. You’re robbing the precious time of children to be children. They need to be in touch with the real world more.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“The future is clear. It’s going to fall apart. What’s the use in worrying? It’s inevitable.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“We get strength and encouragement from watching children.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“The concept of portraying evil and then destroying it—I know this is considered mainstream, but I think it is rotten. This idea that whenever something evil happens someone particular can be blamed and punished for it, in life and in politics is hopeless.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“AI animation is, “is an insult to life itself.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Always believe in yourself. Do this and no matter where you are, you will have nothing to fear.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I never read reviews. I’m not interested. But I value a lot the reactions of the spectators.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Life is a winking light in the darkness.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“If [hand-drawn animation] is a dying craft, we can’t do anything about it. Civilization moves on. Where are all the fresco painters now? Where are the landscape artists? What are they doing now? The world is changing. I have been very fortunate to be able to do the same job for 40 years. That’s rare in any era.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Yet, even amidst the hatred and carnage, life is still worth living. It is possible for wonderful encounters and beautiful things to exist.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“There has never been a work of art created which didn’t somehow reflect its own time.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“It seems like everything that we see perceived in the brain before we actually use our own eyes, that everything we see is coming through computers or machines and then is being input in our brain cells. So that really worries me.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Do everything by hand, even when using the computer.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Young people are surrounded by virtual things. Animators can only draw from their own experiences of pain and shock and emotions.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“The creation of a single world comes from a huge number of fragments and chaos.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“The running of surging masses on fire with anger, the running of a child doing his best to hold back tears until he reaches his house, the running of a heroine who has forsaken everything but the desire to flee—being able to show wonderful ways of running, running that expresses the very act of living, the pulse of life, across the screen would give me enormous delight. I dream of someday coming across a work that requires that kind of running.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I’ve become skeptical of the unwritten rule that just because a boy and girl appear in the same feature, a romance must ensue. Rather, I want to portray a slightly different relationship, one where the two mutually inspire each other to live—if I’m able to, then perhaps I’ll be closer to portraying a true expression of love.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I like the expression ‘lost possibilities.’ To be born means being compelled to choose an era, a place, and a life. To exist here, now, means to lose the possibility of being countless other potential selves. For example, I might have been the captain of a pirate ship, sailing with a lovely princess by my side. It means giving up this universe, giving up other potential selves. There are selves which are lost possibilities, and selves that could have been, and this is not limited just to us but to the people around us and even to Japan itself.

Yet once born,there is no turning back. And I think that’s exactly why the fantasy worlds of cartoon movies so strongly represent our hopes and yearnings. They illustrate a world of lost possibilities for us.”- Hayao Miyazaki
“My process is thinking, thinking and thinking—thinking about my stories for a long time.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“In order to grow your audience, you must betray their expectations.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I am an animator. I feel like I’m the manager of a animation cinema factory. I am not an executive. I’m rather like a foreman, like the boss of a team of craftsmen. That is the spirit of how I work.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I do believe in the power of story. I believe that stories have an important role to play in the formation of human beings, that they can stimulate, amaze, and inspire their listeners.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I try to dig deep into the well of my subconscious. At a certain moment in that process, the lid is opened and very different ideas and visions are liberated. With those I can start making a film. But maybe it’s better that you don’t open that lid completely, because if you release your subconscious it becomes really hard to live a social or family life.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I don’t have the story finished and ready when we start work on a film. I usually don’t have the time. So the story develops when I start drawing storyboards. The production starts very soon thereafter, while the storyboards are still developing. We never know where the story will go but we just keeping working on the film as it develops. It’s a dangerous way to make an animation film and I would like it to be different, but unfortunately, that’s the way I work and everyone else is kind of forced to subject themselves to it.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“All my films are all my children.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“When I have the time, I like to go up to a cabin I have in the mountains. Sometimes friends will come by to visit me, but I also like to spend time alone. It reinvigorates me, hiking those mountain trails. After working on a film, it usually takes half a year for me to recover my mental and physical balance. I have to set aside time to recuperate. I guess when you add it all up, I’m not really working that many hours.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Many of my movies have strong female leads—brave, self-sufficient girls that don’t think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their heart. They’ll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I can’t stand modern movies. The images are too weird and eccentric for me.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“Sometimes I test myself saying, ‘If I get a death sentence if I don’t make this movie, would I still make this movie?” – Hayao Miyazaki
“The characters are born from repetition, from repeatedly thinking about them. I have their outline in my head. I become the character and as the character I visit the locations of the story many, many times. Only after that I start drawing the character, but again I do it many, many times, over and over. And I only finish just before the deadline.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“I would like to make a film to tell children ‘it’s good to be alive.” – Hayao Miyazaki
“From that rooftop, what if you leapt onto the next roof, dashed over to that blue and green wall, jumped and climbed up the pipe, ran across the roof, and jumped to the next? You can, in animation. When you look from above, so many things reveal themselves to you. Maybe race along the concrete wall. Isn’t it fun to see things that way?” – Hayao Miyazaki
“If someone were to ask me what the most important thing is when creating a new animated work, my answer would be that you first have to know what you want to say with it. In other words, you have to have a theme. Surprisingly, perhaps, people sometimes overlook this basic fact of filmmaking and overemphasize technique instead. There are innumerable examples of people making films with a very high level of technique, but only a very fuzzy idea of what they really want to say. And after watching their films, viewers are usually completely befuddled. Yet when people who know what they want to say make films with a low level of technique, we still greatly appreciate the films because there is really something to them.” – Hayao Miyazaki“When the guarantee of safety is dangled right in front of their eyes, humans will turn their eye from probability.” – Saori Shibuki
“With death staring you in the face, you truly understand what it means to be alive.” – Saori Shibuki
“Life is built upon the taking of another life. If you have the resolve to kill, then you have the obligation to eat.” – Usagi Yuzuha
“Just as water can overfill a container. Madness is all the same.” – Ryohei Arisu
“In this world with only despair, how do you live?” – Shuntarou Chishiya
“Do you know the origin of the word “utopia”? The English philosopher, Thomas More, created this word with intense irony in mind. In Greek, it means “A place that does not exist”.” – Shuntarou Chishiya
“Whether it’s on the other side of the planet, or right in front of one’s eyes, as long as one is safe, it doesn’t matter how many others die. Isn’t that humanity?” – Shuntarou Chishiya
“No matter what you do, it’s all futile in this world.” – Shuntarou Chishiya
“Human’s heart… I just don’t wanna learn about.” – Shuntarou Chishiya“Every individual human affects the surrounding environment. But humans do not exist for the things and people around them. Often, they mistakenly think that they wish to exist for the sake of others, or to help everyone. They can not accept that they don’t know why they exist, yes? They always want an answer. That is the nature of the animals called “humans”. – Magata Shiki
“No one fears death. They fear the life that leads up to death. If one could die without suffering, no one would fear death, right? Being alive is, itself, an exception. The natural state of things is death. And life is, itself, a kind of sickness. When the illness is cured, your life vanishes.” – Magata Shiki
“I think I would like someone else to kill me. I want someone else to interfere with my life. Is that not what wanting to be loved means, Saikawa-sensei? No life is born of it’s own volition. Isn’t the instinctive desire of beings, born not of their own volition, for their lives to be taken in the same way?” – Magata Shiki
“It is right for me, but not for you. Either way, the concept of “right” means no more than that.” – Magata Shiki
“Of course. Humans can be kind because there are things they do not understand. If they knew everything, they would attempt nothing. If they attempted nothing, nothing new would happen. Humans seek answers to the things they do not know. That is how kindness, nostalgia, joy, and fun are born.” – Magata Shiki
“Seeing nature and thinking it’s beautiful is what’s unnatural. That means the life you lead is an unclean one. If you can cut yourself off from mother nature and still survive, doesn’t it mean you have enough inner beauty to allow you to do that?” – Souhei Saikawa
“Luxury means something with no meaning at all.” – Souhei Saikawa
“Whenever I get up in the morning, I always think to myself, “Am I really the same person I was yesterday?” For example, just as a computer loads its OS into memory and boots up each time it restarts, is it possible I’m just booting up the person called “Saikawa Sohuei” each morning and trying to play that role?” – Souhei Saikawa“Humans can lie with words. And they can deceive with actions. You can’t trust their eyes, voices, or expressions. But when they’re about to die, their faces show the truth, no matter what.” – Hans Humpty
“Adlet, I hated you. I hated the fact that I was starting to believe in you. I still hate you. The more I talk to you, the more I hate you. I believe you, even though I decided to never believe anyone again.” – Fremy Speeddraw
“Liars always say the same things. “I’ll believe in you. I’ll protect you. I care about you.” I’ll never believe that again… No one will ever protect me. I won’t even think about it. I’ll fight alone, live alone, and die alone. I know… I’ve felt it on my skin and in my body… That it’s better not to believe in anyone than believe and be betrayed!” – Fremy Speeddraw
“I thought that would be the only way I could become the world’s strongest man. But you know… It didn’t work. Your heart isn’t something you can get rid of. If you’re trying to get rid of your heart, your heart is making you do it. You can never abandon everything to get stronger. The one thing you can never stop is falling in love with someone!” – Adlet Mayer
“In order to accomplish something, first you had to believe in yourself that you could do it.” – Adlet Mayer
“I was able to become strong because I still believe those words. That a man can’t become strong for revenge’s sake. He becomes strong because he believes in something.” – Adlet Mayer
“What do you think it means to be the strongest man in the world? The strongest man in the world has power, skill, wisdom, heart, and luck.” – Adlet Mayer“Whether we move forward or stop, we’re going in different directions little by little.” – Suzume Yosano
“If we love someone, we need to tell them about it. That way, we’ll feel relieved and a lot stronger.” – Suzume Yosano
“If you don’t feel anything for me, just leave me alone. I don’t want your tepid kindness.” – Suzume Yosano
“Girls are more fragile than you think. They can be hurt by the smallest things.” – Suzume Yosano
“To turn someone down and to be turned down by someone… To be hurt by someone and to hurt someone… A love where no one gets hurt doesn’t exist.” – Suzume Yosano
“There were many tears, many unsure times, and many troubled moments. The fun memories were only a few, but even so, those memories will shine bright like stardust and continue to shine on in my heart.” – Suzume Yosano
“Even though I’m expressionless, being told that I’m annoying still hurts.” – Suzume Yosano
“Our minds don’t work the way we expect them to.” – Suzume Yosano
“Honestly, someone who asks someone else to convey their feelings for them is the worst.” – Daiki Mamura
“Even if I’m an outsider, even if I’m hers for only a moment, I wanted to become someone special to her. Just by being together with me, just for a little while, I wanted her to be happy.” – Daiki Mamura
“The most annoying thing is that I can’t do anything for you, even though you’re crying.” – Daiki Mamura
“How will you live if every little thing from your memories always hurts you easily?” – Daiki Mamura
“If I’d known that the end would come so fast, I would have said so much more.” – Daiki Mamura
“My heart controls the world.” But who can I control if I’m the only one living in this world?” – Yuyuka Nekota
“At times like these, you shouldn’t depend on people’s advice, but think about it thoroughly by yourself and make a decision. Because there’s no right answer when it comes to love. Whatever your answer is, if it’s your own choice, then it’s right.” – Yuyuka Nekota
“Thinking about whether it’s because of jealousy or just saying it out loud by accident, aren’t they all part of love? Love isn’t always sweet.” – Yuyuka Nekota
“I’m the one who selfishly decides who’s my friend and who’s not.” – Yuyuka Nekota
“You wouldn’t get an answer no matter how much you think about it. Love is not Japanese nor Math. It doesn’t need thoughts of reasons. You will be aware of it when that person is next to you.” – Yuyuka Nekota
“I knew this was a losing battle. Even though the outcome was obvious, I still wanted to bet on that one millimeter of a possibility.” – Satsuki Shishio
“Don’t judge me if you don’t stand in my position.” – Satsuki Shishio“Death by sword. Death by broken bones. Death by crushing. There’s not much difference, right? You die at the end.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“It looks like you’re too weak to even play around with.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Calm down, Albedo. The personalities of you NPCs were created by my old comrades. All your good and bad qualities were created with their hearts. I love all of you because of that. ” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I know your strength and trust you, Albedo. However, until we know more about this world, we must always move forward believing the enemy is stronger than us.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Today is the last day Yggdrasil’s servers will run. Why not stay until the end?” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I hope we meet again somewhere, huh? Just when and where would that be?” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“It’s fine. Everyone makes mistakes. You just need to make an effort not to make the same mistake again.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“In the past, there was no one who did not know this name.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“There was no need for me to fight someone of your level seriously. In other words, you weren’t even an enemy worthy of using magic on.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Ainz Ooal Gown does not know defeat.’ Know this. The strength of the 41 people from Ainz Ooal Gown stands before you! And you did not have any chance of winning from the start! Shalltear Bloodfallen. I am the leader of the supreme beings of the Tomb of Nazarick. Feel the power of the man you all respect and call your master!” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“Don’t say stupid things! How many times do I have to tell you the reason why we’re here?” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I could revive the dead villagers with this Wand of Resurrection. But, a magic caster who brings death and a magic caster who can revive the dead. It’s not hard to imagine which one would be dragged into more trouble. Unless that situation changes, you’ll just have to be satisfied that I saved the village.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“If she betrayed us because she is dissatisfied with me or our treatment of her, I can understand.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“I’ll tell everyone here and now. I am the one at fault. I didn’t think of the possibility, though we had gathered so much information. Shalltear, you are not guilty of anything. Remember this well.” – Ainz Ooal Gown
“The words you’ve said cannot be taken back. So you must take action to paint over what you have already said.” – Dyne Woodwonder
“A power that surpasses demons. Who in the world are you?” – Nigun Grid Luin
“Lord Ainz. The merciful Lord Ainz, who stayed behind with us. Please! Please rule over us forever. I beg you from the bottom of my heart! Please! Please!” – Albedo
“I cannot allow any trash that thinks that of the merciful Lord Ainz to live!” – Albedo
“Why won’t you promise me?! What are you dissatisfied about?! If you tell me, we will quickly eliminate the problem! If you say I’m the one in your way, I would kill myself immediately!” – Albedo
“The leader of the guardians, Albedo. I bow before the supreme one. Other than the guardian of the fourth floor, Gargantua, and the guardian of the eigth floor, Victim, all of the guardians have gathered to bow before you. Please bestow your orders upon us, Supreme One. We offer our complete loyalty to you.” – Albedo
“Saving someone who is in trouble is common sense!” – Touch Me
“Do you realize it now? I am cruel, cold, and terrible. As well as quite a beautiful little monster.” – Shalltear Bloodfallen
“If Lord Ainz perishes, how will you take responsibility?! Lord Ainz is the master we can pledge our loyalty to!” – Demiurge
“I see. You are amazing, Lord Ainz. Your consideration for everything is as expected of the Supreme One. I am in awe of you once again.” – Nabe
“So this great magical creature is the legendary Wise King of the Forest?” – Lizzie
“Are you going to kill him? If you are, I was thinking I’d want to skin him. I think his skin would make a nice hide.” – Aura“There are things that we don’t want to happen, but have to accept. Things that we don’t want to know, but have to learn. And people that we can’t live without, but have to let go.” – Mai Taniyama
“My heart was taken by you, broken by you, and now it’s in pieces because of you.” – Mai Taniyama
“Having the love of your life break up with you and say “we can still be friends”, is like your dog dying and your mom saying “you can still keep it”.” – Mai Taniyama
“Forget him. Forget his name. Forget his face. Forget his kiss, his warm embrace. Forget the love that you once knew. Remember he has someone new. Forget him when they played your song. Remember you cried all night long. Forget how close you once were. Remember he has chosen her. Forget how you memorized his walk. Forget the way he used to talk. Forget the things he used to say. Remember he has gone away. Forget his laugh. Forget his grin. Forget the dimples on his chin. Forget the way he held you tight. Remember he’s with her tonight. Forget the time that went so fast. Forget the love that moved, it’s past. Forget he said he’d leave you never. Remember he has gone forever…” – Mai Taniyama
“No guy is worth your tears. When you find one that is, he won’t make you cry.” – Mai Taniyama
“I’m tired of trying, sick of crying, I know I’ve been smiling, but inside I’m dying.” – Mai Taniyama
“The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right next to them and know you can never have them.” – Mai Taniyama“Destiny is a mysterious thing. It lets people reach their intended destinations.” – Iraha Lemercier
“I don’t need some ring or some throne! If it means that I won’t lose you… I would throw everything away!” – Livius Orvinus Ifrikia
“The world just exists to hurt people and to be conquered. To survive, you mow down your enemies and take what you want.” – Livius Orvinus Ifrikia
“You own the world, but you’ve never looked at any of it. What a waste.” – Nike Lemercier
“I’m not afraid of the times I can’t see him. When I feel pain in my chest, my song grows… The scenery feels closer. The next time I see you… I will, once again, fall in love.” – Nke Lemercier
“Clouds… come here. Drops… fall here. Drive out the flames… tell him… that despite all of this… the world is still beautiful.” – Nike Lemercier
“Any harm that comes to me because of you is harm that I need. I want to share your pain. So I want you to let me fight. With you.” – Nike Lemercier
“The rain, the wind, the sun… you bring them all with you. Every time our eyes meet. You bring the world to me.” – Nike Lemercier
“What you need are feelings and experiences. The feelings of the person seeking the rain must be in concert with those of the person making it.” – Lemercier
“The sun may be wonderful but can you live on that alone? We all live because of the wind, the clouds, and the rain. They’re not things you can throw out just because they’re temporarily inconvenient, right?” – Nike Lemercier“A student who is too loyal to his master has no chance of surpassing that master… A mutinous spirit is the source of independence.” – Boris Konev
“Perfection is a fairly nonexistent thing. If you couldn’t do it, it was probably impossible for anybody else, too.” – Reinhard Von Lohengramm
“Something that’s supposed to die and doesn’t will eventually rot away, whether it’s a man or a nation.” – Reinhard Von Lohengramm
“There is great satisfaction in fighting for the sake of gaining power, but it’s joyless to fight for the sake of maintaining it.” – Reinhard Von Lohengramm
“I’d rather fight and regret it than not fight and regret it.” – Reinhard Von Lohengramm
“For those who have come to power, wealth and glory not by their own strength and effort, but simply through inheritance, what right do they have to complain? The very existence of such blood-lineage dynasties is disgusting. Power is the property of one generation. It shouldn’t be transferred, it should be seized.” – Reinhard Von Lohengramm
“No matter the era, whichever the society, people always gaze at the stars when young. Then they stretch out their hands and try to catch them. And then one day, they realize their arms are not long enough to catch the stars, and that’s when they grow up.” – Reinhard Von Lohengramm
“Even if the clothes are too large in the beginning, they’ll fill out as you grow. The same goes for courage… The secret of not getting killed by the enemy is to underestimate life’s difficulties.” – Olivier Poplan
“One cannot live by jokes alone. But if there were no jokes, I’d rather not live.” – Olivier Poplan
“There certainly are things that cannot be told in words, but that can only be said by people who have exhausted their use of words. Words are like icebergs that are floating on the ocean called “heart”. The parts that show above the sea surface are small, but they still let us perceive the larger parts that are hidden below the water. Use words deliberately. If you do, you’ll be able to convey more things more accurately than if you were to keep silent. Right judgement can only be made with right information and right analyses.” – Yang Wenli
“For as long as human history goes on, the past will continue to accumulate. History isn’t just records of the past. It’s also proof that civilization has continued to advance to the present. Our present civilization is the result of our past.” – Yang Wenli

And finally, lesson 3: Don’t think your parents are always right.” – Yuma Kuga

“I’ve travelled a long road to get here, Tyson. This is my life’s work. Everything I’ve seen and everything I’ve done and it all starts and ends with you. From the first time you defeated me, I’ve known it. I’ve watched you grow ever since. Sometimes you won, sometimes you lost, but you always persevered. No matter how bad things got you always looked deep inside yourself and found the strength to continue. And when a member of the team fell,it was you who always picked him back up. When I realized I could never be like you, the only thing left for me was to defeat you. Only then would I have complete faith in my own skill and strength. I had no choice but to find a way to win, no matter what the cost to myself. That’s why I had to leave the team.” – Kai Hiwatari

“Hamlets mistake is that he believed in something like a ghost, that doesn’t exist. The second he believed in something irrational, he was doomed. Those are just delusions imagined by the living. Once you’re dead, that’s it. The dead don’t return, nor do they hear our wishes. It’s all an illusion. Things you forgot to say, things you couldn’t say… they want ghosts to hear them, so they dream one up. It’s also possible that people imagine their desire as ghosts.” – Mahiro Fuwa

You did what you shouldn’t have, and didn’t do as you should have. Because you relied on someone else’s script, you were wrong. I won’t live my life by another person’s script.

I am a being that wields the destruction’s that only a natural disaster should be able to wield, with a single will, and destroy anything by his impulses.” – Azi Dahaka

“People can’t live without their memories. But hey can’t live on their memories alone either. They have to wake up from their dreams. Those dreams will become sadness if they don’t.

You can’t see it because you’re closing your eyes on purpose. Because if you use your eyes to see it, it’ll be painful, and sad. That’s why they’re closed in the first place.

“The gods have, since ancient times, created methods to test humans. The system God has created… it opposes all living creatures and splits the world. It condemns people to roles. Heaven pretends they can’t see the suffering of the people. Only the lucky few find the way. The pain of those beings reaches deep into my heart. I want to counter this discrimination and extend a helping hand. In order to do that, the only thing that can be done is to create a new system! See… this is what God has wrought… I cannot allow such a system to continue! This is the will of my quarrel with Heaven. I would like you to come with me. If I had your help, even the weak-of-heart could have their wishes fulfilled. So that everyone can be equal and happy, I wish to reach out.” – Celestine

I just remember that the bird was in the dream with me, and that the bird was someone in the form of a bird, trying to call me back. I now know that I was never alone.” – Rakka

Life shouldn’t be like that. You have got to try as much as you can. If not, you will never find the real you.” – Ja Wangnan
“When I first came to this floor, I had many friends. We had delicious sweet and sour pork together. But then my friends gave up on the test one by one, and I was the only one left, eating food by myself. When I saw that empty bowl, it felt like people were telling me to give up. Saying that I was all alone and hopeless, and I hated that. At last, I have found someone to enjoy delivery food with. Now I have someone to eat with, but he is dead. Does this Tower make our dreams come true or force us to gave up our dreams?” – Ja Wangnan

“One of the lessons I have learned from the many battles I have fought to get Lord Evankhell to teach me is that leaders who hide at the back of a battlefield don’t deserve any mercy.

“Your god is a fragment of your imagination from your weakness.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“The heart moves where the heart wills.” – Twenty Fifth Baam

“I may still be too weak to save everyone. But still, if I have to choose someone to sacrifice, I would rather sacrifice myself first. I still can’t give up on anyone.” – Twenty Fifth Baam

“Those who try to step over someone else and go up higher… are actually only running away from some fear that they cannot see. Trying to step over someone is a cowardly action. It means you’re not confident enough to face the opponent and speak to them with the same viewpoint. It doesn’t matter how much power I have in me. By using that “power” that’s taking over you. I do not want to become such a cowardly person. I will fight and get hurt in order to survive.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“I want to be strong. So that I don’t have to say goodbyes anymore. How strong do I have to be not to lose any more friends? I don’t want to say goodbyes anymore.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“But the power that you are talking about is not that power. The power you are talking about is not my true power. The power you are talking about is meaningful only if “I have someone under me”. The one who had locked me up in a cave for such a long time must have done it thinking something like that. But I don’t need such power. The power that gives one pleasure by having someone under you. The power that calls for hatred and fear cannot be justified. That is a false power. Please show me my true power now. You are fake.” – Twenty Fifth Baam

I don’t have parents… or a home… a single set of dirty clothes is all I have. I always thought that I might die alone without ever being able to do anything… But now- I have friends. Thank you.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“I was trapped in darkness for a long time after I was born. I followed my only light and I came into this Tower. All those people I met here, the memories I shared with them, they are my precious ones I have had for the first time of my life. I have tried so hard to protect them. They are mine.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“Why did you attack my friends? They have nothing to do with you. You are nothing but a twisted one. You didn’t hate me because you wanted to revenge. You just needed someone to hate.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“Even if things get difficult, I have people I have to be with. So, no matter what comes my way, I will go back to where I belong.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“I’ll go with you. But if you try playing with my friends’ lives like this again… I will kill all of you.” – Twenty Fifth Baam
“You really are glowing. You have always told me I was like a shining star to you. But I knew, you are the one destined to shine like a star someday, not me. I was just destined to look at you shining from a place in the dark forever. I was afraid of that ‘Destiny.” – Rachel
“You think everyone has to live according to a fixed destiny? Don’t be silly. No one on the outside lives like that. Destiny only has value when you create it yourself!! I know very well!! It’s foolish to devote your own life to destiny like that!” – Rachel
“What I want is simply a blue sky, countless stars and a cool breeze. That ridiculously beautiful view which that person wants for their entire life. If only I may be able to see that sight myself, I would be satisfied with that.” – Rachel
“Yeah. Must be lonely. No friends, Mom nor Dad, just him and the stars together. I think it’d be very lonely. Why do you think he built the tower by himself? When being together is this much fun. Isn’t it? Baam.” – Rachel
“Betraying is bad! No matter what happens, you must never betray another person! Especially not a woman. If you betray a woman, the world’s ceiling will collapse.” – Rachel
“Sly woman? Yes, you may be right. But to someone else, I’m the brightest woman ever. That’s right. To that guy, I’m somewhat like a star. A star that shines so bright. That’s what I should be like to that guy.” – Rachel
“I’m used to being hated anyway. I have also climbed the Tower before with a man who wanted to kill me. But it’s always like that, is it? Even if you are not close companions or friends, you can use your mutual goals and apparent friendship as an excuse to climb the Tower together. Isn’t that right? What I want is neither for you to become my friend nor to become my companion. I just want to climb the Tower together like others. Then you can save your companion’s life and your ideals.” – Rachel
“This world is so dark…I can’t stand living in it anymore. I’m sorry Baam… I’m sorry… Please forget about me. So that I could be reborn.” – Rachel
“You said you would teach me the way to be the heroine when you were guiding me. But it was a lie. The hero you choose was Baam. And I was just bait to make him go up the Tower. But I have found the way to become a heroine myself. It’s nothing special. If I wasn’t born to become a heroine from beginning, all I need was people who would send me to the top of the Tower in this awful darkness. If I break my legs, I will find the one who will walk for me. If I go blind, I will find the one who will see for me. If my thorn breaks, I will find the one who will be my thorn. All I need to do is find them. The guy behind the door right now is the one who will be my first thorn.” – Rachel
“I don’t care how I do it. And I don’t care if it’s not true friendship. As long as I can gather people who I can rely on, it’s all good even if it’s a fake friendship.” – Rachel

“Don’t mind any of this. The things that you have heard here. The things that you have seen here. The things that the people here want from you- Don’t pay attention to any of it. You are you. Don’t ever lose yourself.” – Urek Mazino
“What fun would it be to become the king of the Tower? Tell Zahard to keep his boring seat. I will get out of the Tower. Outside the Tower, there exists a vast world, rolling skies stretch endlessly, and countless stars illuminate the darkness. A place that is a thousand times — no, a billion times wider and freer than the tower. Once you imagine that such a world exists, don’t you think all those things you want are all so trivial?” – Urek Mazino
“That reckless idiot is sure giving you a hard time, baby. But don’t worry anymore. The hero has arrived. Right now, I’m so full of the power of love that I’m invincible!” – Urek Mazino“Even if we’re apart, I won’t forget about you.” – Kanan Matsuura

“The human mind is uncertain things. Within mind, even contradictory thoughts may coexist.” – Shionji Yuuko

But the information us detectives dig up is nothing more than the truth as recorded in Heaven’s Memo Pad.” – Shionji Yuuko
“NEETs aren’t people who can’t do or won’t do things. The only difference is the rules. Because we’re playing with different rules, we’re forced to do things differently.

“A normal detective eavesdrops, goes on stakeouts, and gathers information by foot to find out what they’re looking for. But a NEET detective can search the world over to find the truth without stepping out of their room!” – Shionji Yuuko

“For the first time, I felt honoured at being allowed to compete in this game of truth and error, and witches as a human… And ironically, that taught me that the truth is not necessarily only one when I believed that only one truth existed. By just broadening my field of vision a little, I can see a truth that is completely different. And no matter which one of the truths, if you can only see one of them, they will not be the right answer… Ah, in my life until now, I wonder how many truths have I turned away from because I was blinded by some trivial truth…?

“‘Slacking off’ sounds bad. However, enjoying more of your day with the time you saved by doing your job in a clever way is definitely not a bad thing.

In short, if all you care about is your job, you’re not fully mature.” – Gaap

There are many painful, sad moments. But this is what I think: sad and painful things definitely happen for a reason. Nothing in this world is pointless.” – Ringo Oginome
“I hate the word “fate.” Birth, encounters, partings, success and failures, fortune and misfortunes in life. If our lives are already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born?

Because, ever since that day, none of us had a future and the only certain thing was that we wouldn’t amount to anything…” – Takakura Shouma
“Why are people born? If people are born only to suffer the hard life, is it meant as some kind of punishment? Or a cynical joke?

“I realized one morning… That I hate this world. This world is made of countless boxes. People bend and stuff their bodies into their own boxes. And stay there for the rest of their lives.

That’s why I’m going to destroy this world.” – Sanetoshi Watase
“In the human world, truth and reality aren’t always one and the same. Humans just call their desires and ambitions as “truth”. Humans will even kill other humans if they have “truth” as an excuse.” – Sanetoshi Watase
“You see, there was this girl and she just appeared out of the blue. To my surprise, she was the same kind of person as me, and she had the same kind of eyes, at first sight, I realized I wasn’t a solitary existence in this world, I was so happy. That’s right, until I met her, I was all alone in this world, I had not a soul with whom to share the scenery before my eyes, and not a soul with whom to share the music in my ears. But…I heard the voices all over the world, I could hear the whole world crying out, “save me”. It’s true, thus I could see the optimal path of the world. But it saddened me, because the moment I saw her – I knew we were never meant to be, yes, she refused to side with me. She rejected me – the only person who could see the same scenery.” – Sanetoshi Watase

The important part is that because the boy believed in his lies, he really brought a wolf to the village. You can’t deny that!” – Yoshiro Hoshimiya
“I find it fascinating how we can see something with our eyes, hear with our ears and speak from our mouths. Although science tells us how they work, I just really can’t grasp it. I don’t know how everyday items like phones work. I can’t even explain why a bicycle is fast. When I think like this, I wonder how many things I really understand. Yet I can live on. Because all these mysteries have joined together to keep me alive. Sometimes I admire that before I go to bed.” – Mifune Ryuuko

“I borrowed it from the Headmaster. It’s a gun to use against vampires. If I lose the human part of me, and go mad as a vampire…shoot me with that gun. Not yet, but that day will eventually come. Kill me by your own hand then.” – Zero Kiriyu
“The Headmaster talks about the Night Class like they’re good vampires who support his pacifism, but I don’t trust them. I won’t let my guard down. I’m cooperating so I can find the most effective way to kill those beasts in human form.” – Zero Kiriyu
“That’s why for you, you have the right to be cruel to me. No matter how much you make me worry or how much danger you put me in, just as much as you like. But these are not enough “compensation”. Even if I have to sacrifice my life over life for you, I would not utter a word of complaint.” – Zero Kiriyu

“I couldn’t stop myself from devouring you. I may kill the next human I target as my prey. Shoot me. You’re afraid of me, aren’t you? Hold the gun with both hands, and aim straight. Aim for my heart. It’s not a crime to kill a vampire.” – Zero Kiriyu
“She’s not small… In my heart her existence is not small.” – Zero Kiriyu
“Her warm hands against my face like that… They were like a plank I would hold on to, so I wouldn’t drown.” – Zero Kiriyu
“If you go one step ahead of me, I’ll make you cry.” – Zero Kiriyu“As time goes by without anyone eating it, it starts getting dry and looking anything but appetizing, and no one’s willing to make a move, but when the busboy takes it you go ‘wait, we’re not done with that yet.’ kinda on reflex.

“Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary.

Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.” – Puppet Master
“You were wrong on two counts. Even the hardest substance can be broken, when crashed into itself. And the ability to feel pain is not a weakness. It’s a strength. Pain tells a creature its vulnerabilities, and not you expose them to attack. Your robot is dead. And so, I’m afraid, are you.” – Kurama
“Because of our weakness, we trained our eyes, ears and the ability to think. Learning how to survive, that’s our trait as humans! The human species can’t use magic and can’t even perceive it—but because we are weak, we have the wisdom to run away from magic and the intelligence to see through it! We don’t have any extraordinary senses. But because we are weak, by learning and gaining experience, we gained the wisdom to achieve the unachievable—to predict the future…Rejoice! We are humans; we are the most talented people! Precisely because we were born without any ability, we can achieve anything. This is the will of the weakest race!” – Sora

“Kindness is weakness. Your weakness will delay the trigger by a moment. This world doesn’t treat kindness kindly.” – Koko Hekmatyar
“Weaklings will stay weak forever. But weakness is not evil, since human beings are weak creatures to begin with. Alone, you feel nothing but insecurity; that’s why we form guilds, that’s why we have friends. We walk together in order to live a strong life. The clumsy ones will walk into more walls than the others, and it may also take them longer to get there. If you believe in tomorrow and put yourself out there, you can naturally obtain your strength. That’s how you will be able to smile and live strong.” – Makarov Dreyar

“It’s because we don’t understand! It’s because we don’t understand that we wonder what the other is thinking and try desperately to understand every word they say… You end up thinking too much about the other person, and being close to them becomes painful so you try to distance yourself… I believe you become friends with somebody by doing that over and over, and that’s how… As much as I hate to admit it, it’s how I became friends with these guys.” – Maki Honoka

“The most important thing when fighting and running away is to defend. It is not about beating the enemy in front of them, but to retreat while buying time for their comrades to retreat.” – Yoshii Akihisa

“Fear comes from within, and isn’t something that can be conquered psychologically in such a short while.” – Yoshii Akihisa

“No matter what, anyone would hate to be weak as they get plundered. But if there’s a chance, even if humans fail to get what they want, they can unexpectedly accept such an outcome.” – Sakamoto Yuuji

“Once a person is ready to die, anything is possible.” – Shimada Minami
“Aki, you can’t lie when you confess to someone. I’m trying to comfort you now, but if I just wanted to comfort you, I won’t confess to you. I confessed to you like this because I really like you.

“Yoshii Akihisa-kun, when a person with ability, but is unfairly treated, tries to get back the position he deserves, will you step in to interfere?” – Takashiro Masaharu
“I’ve always been wondering, even though you’ve been treating me carefully like a princess, are you just trying to keep your distance away from me? You praise me so much and belittle yourself, so I feel that you’re trying to keep your distance away from me…” – Himeji Mizuki
“I’m sorry for not saying this to you, Akihisa-kun. I know I shouldn’t hide this from you, but I was wondering whether I should tell you this. Because if I told you that, you’ll definitely tell me “you should go”, or something like that. I understand you’ll say that for my sake, but I don’t wish to hear you say anything like a farewell to me, Akihisa-kun. Because– I like you, Akihisa-kun!” – Himeji Mizuki

“It’s all right to grieve over your defeat. It’s important to admit when you’ve lost. Not being able to do so makes it impossible for you to climb back up after a fall, and even more impossible, for you to move forward. So go on ahead and grieve to your heart’s extent. But after you’re done grieving, be sure to set your eyes upon your next goal and move towards it.” – Yoshii Akira“After all this time, after being by your side and always looking after you I failed to make a place for myself deep within your heart.” – Masafumi Takeuchi

“No one actually knows what’s best or what the future holds. Until you actually see the results, no one ever knows. So at the very least, why don’t we rely on what we do know. Let’s keep the feelings that we have right now precious. Even though it seems like our lives never change, they slowly do. And just like how we never notice… the changing of the seasons… the same goes for our hearts.” – Nanami Takahashi

“I wish I could rewrite my past.. but I can’t. If I could, I’d do all I could if it would stop you from crying. But.. that’s impossible. My past won’t change. That’s why we need to make my past pale in comparison to our present.” – Motoharu Yano
“Listen carefully because I’m only gonna say this once, I love you.” – Motoharu Yano
“Human memories aren’t reliable. Your brain will add something or just glorify it, memories make you believe what happened was better than it actually was.” – Motoharu Yano
“I’ve always been asking myself this question. Am I a memory? or is the memory… ME? Are we nothing but a collection of memories?” – Motoharu Yano
“Human memories are too vague. Thinking something has color when it doesn’t, making things more dramatic than they really are, glorifying things… It gives new greater meaning than was actually there. That’s why I don’t believe any of this talk about “beautiful memories”. – Motoharu Yano
“Ever since I met you, I feel like… I’ve lived to meet you.” – Motoharu Yano
“I want to go back and change the past. If I could – I would, if that would stop you from crying.” – Motoharu Yano

“The whale leaps. As high as he can imagine. Piercing the water from peak to peak. Is a yearning for the sky reflected in his eyes? What if this high point wasn’t merely the sky, but something far higher? If he knew of the infinite glitter of the stars, would his dreams soar even higher? Even if one doesn’t know why, to live is to constantly reach out. Not to a nervous restlessness, but to a constant motion of the heart.” – Nino
“First, we are born in the same galaxy. Born of the same species. Our lifetimes overlap. The meetings between humans are so unlikely as to be miraculous. To laugh, to cry, and to fall in love… Everyone is made up of a collection of 1% chances. Thus, I’m dazzled by the fact that there are so many miracles in this world.” – Kou Ichinomiya
“A “Wish”. It isn’t a shimmering glass ball that will shatter if grasped firmly. It’s a darkly lustrous ball of mud which only firms up when one squeezes it. It’s form may be uneven, but it’s the form of one’s own fingers. Not to make it a beautiful gem someday. But to make it the world’s most beautiful ball of mud.” – Kou Ichinomiya
“If there is a creator, he surely made this world too large. This is inconvenient for us small, fearful humans. For all the world’s vastness, we can’t measure the distance between ourselves. There are 6 billion of us, yet still, everyone is alone. That is why we are all frantically searching for that one person we need no distance from.” – Kou Ichinomiya
“Leaving my mother’s body, for the first time I learned the chill of cold air and the warmth of human hands. Cradled by my father and carried out of that room, for the first time, I learned the extent of the sky and the vast expanse of the world. Stepping off my everyday path, I learned my own laugh which I’d never yet heard. Beyond…Beyond this planet..To learn what I still don’t know. One more step beyond… Closer to you.” – Kou Ichinomiya
“If I were to compare a human’s heart with the ocean, the water would be stagnant. If I were to name the ripples on the water surface….Would it be happiness? Or anger? No. For this ocean, such a description is too shallow. If I want to know what lies upon the deep ocean floors… I would have to open my eyes in the stagnant water. Then swim downwards while enduring the icy deep kicking through the cold and heavy ocean waters. If I truly want to know the human known as myself….even if.. there is nothing there.” – Kou Ichinomiya
“Waiting for you. Waiting for your knock. The only thing that stands between us is a single door. Shining my shoes and placing a piece of eternally fresh bread in my pocket, I prepare for my journey. When you’re ready, just look up at me. Right now, I’m just waiting for you…Waiting for your knock.” – Kou Ichinomiya
“I thought that when I grew up, I could reach more and more. The delicious looking fruit beckoning from the highest branch. The beautiful shell hidden in the sand. If I could only stretch out my hand a little more…. But…. As everyone passes through the junctures of their life, they no longer stretch their hand to the sky, or crouch to the earth. Embarrassed, they ignore what they’d desired for so long. Will you reach out and grab me, grown up as I am?” – Kou Ichinomiya“We won’t know if we don’t even try.” – Vanno Clemente

“God helps those who help themselves.” – Nero Vanetti“You don’t like being lonely, but you’re afraid of people expressing their affection towards you. You pretend not to notice. You run away.

“No one’s more aware of discrimination than the ones being discriminated against, huh?” – Tatsuya Shiba
“Wiping out any and all injuries as if they never happened. A spell like that… Do you really believe he can cast it without paying any price? In order to rewind the Eidos changelog and make a full copy, the stored information must be read in its entirety. Needless to say, that includes the pain and suffering experienced by the injured party. Not only that, but it’s transmitted instantaneously in condensed form. For example, from the time that Isori was injured until brother cast his spell, roughly 30 seconds had gone by. Whereas the time Brother spent reading the Eidos changelog… was approximately 0.2 seconds. In that blink of an eye, my Brother’s mind felt 150 times the pain and suffering experienced by Isori, condensed. Every time Brother heals someone’s wounds, that is the price he pays. Do you really mean to say that he should still use that power for others?” – Miyuki Shiba“Now watch closely, everyone. I’m going to show you how to kill a god. A god of life and death.

“The trees cry out as they die, but you cannot hear them. I lie here. I listen to the pain of the forest and feel the ache of the bullet in my chest and dream of the day when I will finally crunch that gun woman’s head in my jaws… She is my daughter. One of the wolf tribe. When the forest dies, so does she. I caught her human parents defiling my forest. They threw their baby at my feet as they ran away. Instead of eating her, I raised her as my own. Now my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter is neither human nor wolf.” – Moro
“The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away. Life and death are his alone.” – Moro

“Rarely does one have the chance to exchange blows with heroes from another age. And with the chance to fight as many as six, I can’t allow one of them to fall right now. Look at Saber and Lancer. Both are valiant warriors I would love to duel with. It’d be a pity to let either die.” – Rider
“Impossible, right? Compared to the enemy we’re facing, you and I are the same, no more than dots! What’s the point in comparing our heights? That is what makes this exciting! The smallest, the weakest – it doesn’t matter! I should still wish to go and take over the world, with nothing more than my tiny dot of a body! Within my chest, beats the heart of the King of Conquerors!” – Rider
“Indeed. I wanted to see Oceanus with my own eyes. Unfortunately, my dream never came true. Oceanus is still my final destination. A dream that never ends. Go ahead and laugh. Two thousand years later, and I still have the same dream. Every bit the fool as well. And so boy… a pact with a fellow idiot seems ideal.” – Rider
“Up until now, have you not faced the same enemies as I? That means you are my friend! So hold your chest high, and consider yourself my equal.” – Rider
“A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead! Saber, you said you would become a martyr for your ideals. In life, you must have been a pure saint. A proud and noble figure, certainly. But who can truly admire the martyr’s thorny path? Who dreams of such an ending? A king… The king must be greedier than any other. He must laugh louder and rage harder. He must exemplify the extreme of all things, good and evil. That is why his retainers envy and adore him. And why the flames of aspiration, to be as the king is, can burn within his people.” – Rider
“A cowardly thief would sneak away in the night; the King of Conquerors leaves with his loot amidst songs of victory!” – Rider
“The righteousness and ideals you bore may indeed have saved your nation once. However, I’m certain you know what became of those who were saved, but left to themselves. You saved them, but you never led them. You never showed them what a king should be. You abandoned your men when they lost their way. Then, alone and untroubled, you followed your own petty little ideals. Thus, you are no true king. You are only a little girl, enraptured by a false idol of the king who serves others, but not themselves.” – Rider
“Even if I am to carry all the evils of this world, it won’t matter. If that can save the world, then I’d gladly accept it.” – Kiritsugu Emiya
“In the battlefield, there is no place for hope. What lies there is only cold despair and a sin called victory, built on the pain of the defeated. All those people who met there have wholeheartedly admitted the evil and foolishness of this act called war. As long as people don’t repent and don’t regard it as the most evil taboo, then hell will endlessly reappear in the world.” – Kiritsugu Emiya
“And there you go. You heard her, Iri. Our Heroic Spirit thinks a battlefield to be something better than Hell. What a joke. It’s Hell itself. There is no hope on a battlefield. There is nothing but unspeakable despair. Just a crime we call victory, paid for by the pain of the defeated. But humanity has never recognized this truth. And the reason is that, in every era, a dazzling hero has blinded the people with their legends, and kept them from seeing the evil of bloodshed. True human nature has not advanced a step beyond the Stone Age.” – Kiritsugu Emiya
“Justice cannot save the world. It is useless.” – Kiritsugu Emiya
“The world as it is, the human nature as always, it is impossible to eliminate battles. In the end, killing is necessarily evil. If so, it is best to end them in the maximum efficiency and at the least cost, least time. If you want to slander that as foul and demean that as nasty, then do as you wish. Justice can not save the world. I have no interest with things like that.” – Kiritsugu Emiya
“Humans did not realize that truth no matter how high they staked their mountains of corpses. That’s because in no matter what era the courageous and fearless great heroes have always bedazzled the eyes of the multitude with their splendid heroic legends. Because of the wistful actions of those idiots and their refusal to admit that bloodshed is by itself evil, the essence of humans has stayed on the same spot since the Stone Age!” – Kiritsugu Emiya
“I don’t think it’s possible to save everyone. I just want to save as many as I can.” – Kiritsugu Emiya

Let the wish it grants bring disaster! And when you fall into the pits of hell… remember the rage of Diarmuid!” – Lancer

“One’s true worth shows as hardship increases.” – Risei Kotomine
“Children’s minds are immature. They do not possess a firm resolve and the strength to turn their misery to anger. Confronted with a cruel fate, they were not provided with the choice of having a strong will. Moreover, as they have not lived through and comprehended life, ideals such as honor and hope are yet to be completely nurtured in them. Therefore, in moments of despair, children are more prone than adults to seal away their own mind, lock up their own heart. Because they have not tasted the joy of life they can afford to discard. Because they have not understood the meaning of future, they can sink into despair.” – Matou Kariya

“What we call the human heart… It’s such a mystery, isn’t it?” – Irisviel Von Einzbern

“I am who I am because I learned your ideals and took your prayers to the heart. You’ve guided me. You’ve given me a life a mere puppet wouldn’t have. You need not to pity me. I am a part of you.” – Irisviel Von Einzbern
“I am the alienated, the ridiculed, the despised. No need to praise my name. No need to envy my body. I am the shadow under the radiance of heroic spirits. Birthed of the darkness of glorious legend. And so, I hate, I resent. Nourished by the sighs of the people precipitated within the darkness, people that curse the light. This is my disgrace. Because of her unsullied glory, I must forever be belittled.” – Berserker

“The weight of my sword is the weight of my pride. The wound from my battle with you is an honor, not a fetter.” – Saber

“My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven’t lost hope.

“With Roku gone and the Great Comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world. I knew the next Avatar would be born an Air Nomad so I wiped out the Air Temples, but somehow the new Avatar eluded me. I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain.

“People like us aren’t qualified to be involved in a dramatic incident such as a suicide. No matter how depressed you are or how much pain you’re in, you have to return to your routine, daily life.

Therefore, there’s no need to go out of your way like this. What does it matter if you’re scorned by some female?” – Kaoru Yamazaki
“In my heart, I really do long for that kind of drama because there is truth in those television shows. Because there’s the introduction, development, turn, and resolution; there’s an explosion of emotions, and there’s the conclusion. . . On the other hand, our lives continually are filled with dim, dreamy anxiety, and there are no easily understood dramas, situations, or confrontations—nothing at all like that. . . Isn’t that sort of absurd? I’m twenty, and you’re twenty-two, Satou. Even so, we’ve never really loved anyone, hated anyone, fought as a result of love or hate, or had any of those experiences at all. It’s terrible!” – Kaoru Yamazaki
“if you can’t be self-confident, then just imagine the person you’re speaking to as even more of a failure than you think you are!” – Misaki Nakahara

“Because of our broken instincts, we are in pain. We continue living in pain, because our instincts have been twisted by reason. So, what are we supposed to do? Should we abandon knowledge?

“Question: Why can one keep living as a hikikomori? Answer: Because one’s food, clothing and shelter are assured. It’s because one is permitted a lukewarm bare minimum of a life that one can keep living as a hikikomori indefinitely. Being able to live as a hikikomori was in itself very much a luxury. Without the assurance of food, clothing and shelter, unless you’re prepared to die, there’s no other way but to work.” – Satou Tatsuhiro

“A normal life within society would be impossible for someone like me, who cried so unsuccessfully to apply Freudian analysis to last night’s dream. My dream featured indulging in an impure heterosexual relationship in a small room with the female upperclassman from high school, and my analysis suggested only that it indicated a subconscious desire to indulge an impure heterosexual relationship in a small room with the female upperclassman from high school. My final result concluded, “What part of this is a dream interpretation? You’re just reiterating the same thing!” – Satou Tatsuhiro

“No human beings, regardless of who they might be, want to look directly at their own shortcomings.” – Satou Tatsuhiro
“I didn’t really understand Yamazaki’s anger, but becoming furious allowed him to put off thinking about these problems. He acted as though he would simply not commit to anything, even if everything caved in around him. I decided to follow his example and just avoid reality for the time being.” – Satou Tatsuhiro
“It’s natural for a person to deny he’s a failure as a human being. That’s why he searches for somebody who is more miserable than himself. That’s why so much animosity exists on the internet. Those who aren’t able to find a more miserable person, turn to the internet and call other people losers, even though they’ve never met. Just to make themselves feel superior. Isn’t that pathetic? There’s a sense of security that comes from speaking badly of someone else. But that isn’t true salvation.” – Satou Tatsuhiro“Wishes shouldn’t be granted. They’re better off not coming true. When their wishes aren’t granted, people actually put in effort. It’s because they don’t come true that people make progress. But if all their wishes come true, people won’t be able to move forward anymore, you know?” – Alis Color

“I do want to die. But I want to die happily. Like I have for others, I want someone to wave me off.

“Well, you’ve all gotten stronger by evolving, right? It means you shouldn’t let that get to your head and push weaker races around. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re better than them. You don’t want them getting stronger themselves and retaliating someday, do you?” – Rimuru Tempest
“No one died, so we’ll say it’s all good.” – Rimuru Tempest
“The Lizardmen will share a clean water resource and fish, the Goblins will offer places to live, and our town will give them processed goods. And in return, the Orcs will contribute labor. All the races of the Great Forest of Jura will form an alliance and build a mutually cooperative relationship. It’d be really cool if we could create a nation where all races could coexist!” – Rimuru Tempest
“To everyone who went against us, we will bare our fangs and retaliate. To everyone who lends their hands to us, we will grant our blessing to them. To our opponents, we will do to them what they have done to us. In the future, I hope that we can be linked in a friendship one day.” – Rimuru Tempest

“Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living.” – Kiki
“I think it’s better to leave with decorum and great dignity.” – Jiji

“All right, first: don’t panic! Second: don’t panic! And third: did I mention not to panic?” – Jiji“I see. Joining me was just a ruse to destroy me right here. It was all a lie! The smiles she showed me, and her acts of kindness, were all fake!” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Also, feel free to tell people about me. Tell them that any trader who messes with me will end up with bite marks all over.” – Naofumi Iwatani

“With no need to work part-time, I got to enjoy an idyllic Otaku life. That said, I certainly wasn’t one of your so-called shut-ins. When I’d run out of money to spend, I’d go to the library to browse through my light novels. I was a completely run-of-the-mill Otaku leading a completely ordinary life… but it all changed when I picked up this book.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“I shall handle the waves my way then. Get off me already.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“This is what you wanted right? You can shove it up your a*s.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Because I’m the shield hero, because I’m weak they’re trying to knock me down to make themselves look better. Disgusting.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“I’ve gained more important things thanks to becoming the shield hero. Wherever the waves go I’ll go with my friends.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“I’ve never heard of a hero who abandons a child to run away.” – Naofumi Iwatani

“I’d rather have money than words.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Uh, I’m pretty sure a shield is more like armor than a weapon. And where’s the heroine, anyway? I don’t think it’s this princess. She seems kinda sl*tty.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“I have to grow stronger… along with the people who believe in me, and I’ll protect them, come what may!” – Naofumi Iwatani
“The shield’s role would be to thwart enemy attacks and defend the party, right? And while my life back home was devoid of romance, I might just meet the one here. It’ll be fine. I’ve been summoned to another world, after all. Even if I’m weak, things will work out. All right, I’m gonna give it my all!” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Didn’t I swear to protect Raphtalia, Filo, And all the villagers?” – Naofumi Iwatani
“You attack and I defend. That way, neither of us will die.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“Listen Raphtalia. Take that thing out here and now. If you fight and make me stronger, we can fend off the waves of Catastrophe and prevent that tragedy from reoccurring. Your parents won’t ever come back. But we can prevent other kids from going through what you did. And all I’m capable of is making sure you can fight as best as you can.” – Naofumi Iwatani
“What the hell are you people standing around for? Naofumi-sama is fighting in our place! That’s right, if only I weren’t so useless..If i only were stronger… I wouldn’t have to put him through this. You have the power, so why won’t you fight? How can you call yourselves the world’s heroes like that?” – Raphtalia
“I know you better than anyone else in this world. I know how kind you are. So even if the whole world speaks ill of you, I’ll tell them they’re wrong. I’ll tell them again and again that you’re a wonderful person. You’re the one who saved my life, gave me a sword, and showed me my purpose in life. I am your sword. I will follow you through fire and brimstone.” Raphtalia
“What kind of knight neglects the people he’s meant to defend?” – Raphtalia
“Naofumi-sama..Well, I just want to say…I’m truly grateful I met you. You cured my illness and fed me warm meals. You taught me how to live. And you gave me a reason to fight…a reason to fight the waves. I am your sword! Where you go, I will go with you.” – Raphtalia
“I mean sure I’m still an unreliable kid who cries at the drop of a hat. I may even be a burden. But please let me stand by your side. I need you Naofumi-Sama.” – Raphtalia
“I’m happy that we’re staying in a hot springs inn, but Filo’s being too clingy with Naofumi-sama. I want to be clingy with him too!” – Raphtalia
“I am Naofumi-sama’s sword. None may disrespect him in my presence.” – Raphtalia
“Did you do this knowing Naofumi-sama was here?! Depending on your answer, I’ll have your head!” – Raphtalia
“Naofumi-Sama. Don’t ever die. Please don’t leave me alone.” – Raphtalia

“Another young girl? You really are a lolicon, huh?” – Erhard
“It’s been far too long…sister. Please don’t think your or the hero’s privilege can cover up this mess. Spear Hero…look around you. Who would call a man that puts lives at risk a hero?” – Melty Q Melromarc

“If you don’t tell them you’re wrong, you’re basically admitting your guilt.” – Fitoria“No one can change the past. The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes.

“It’s only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others. But who to fight for? How hard must you fight…? That’s the true measure of what human life is worth. We defense attorneys are warriors who are constantly challenged by that question. Even when the battle is over, and the bonds that connect us are severed…We always return…Time and time again.” – Phoenix Wright

“Wright? I hope you see the importance of evidence now. Also, hopefully you realize, things change depending on how you look at them. People, too. We never really know if our clients are guilty or innocent. All we can do is believe in them. And in order to believe in them, you have to believe in yourself.” – Mia Fey
“Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!” – Mia Fey

“The law is the end product of many years of history…the fruit of human knowledge! Like a gem, polished to a gleam through trials…and errors. It is this fruit we receive, and pass on, and face in our time. And it is always changing, growing. Nurturing it is our task as human beings.” – Judge

“To live is to undertake a journey – no, to undertake a journey is to live. To face the wind or to follow it, all journeys lead to the gates of death… The light in which all journeys are taken is deceptive – not hopeful, but sorrowful. And the struggle never ends. Everywhere on the earth is fleeting life. We are blown by the wind. The words we write in the sand disappear and finally, when we are swallowed by the sea we do not hear the waves. The humblest of creatures must face these dreadful barriers.” – Guibu

“I cannot afford to fall here!” – Arslan
“The throne itself does not half a will of its own. Depending upon who sits in it, it can be the seat of justice or it can be the seat of inhuman cruelty. As long as it is a man and not a god, doing the governing, he can never be perfect. But should he neglect to make efforts to reach for perfection, a king will surely tumble down the slippery slope towards evil with no one around to stop him.” – Farangis

“Look. Look at me! Watch as the man you cast out spills his blood and dies. Take a nice long look! I will save you all. I want you to live the rest of your lives knowing the man you abandoned saved you. And I will laugh at you from the afterlife. And tell you that it serves you right!” – Ikoma
“We are weak, Mumei. But, that doesn’t mean we just roll over and accept our fate.” – Ikoma

“Those who underestimate their enemies will not last long in this world.” – Horobi“Once drowned in the depths of darkness, you lose sight of light. When that light has dispersed there is no return. My light has died out long ago and so there’s nothing back for me to go back, or look forward to I shall continue to indulge myself in this darkness until it completely consumes me, then I will be nothing but an empty course left on this cold & cruel world to rot.” – Alois Trancy

“I have a dream at last. The butterfly trapped in a spiderweb has no wings. That butterfly is… me.” – Alois Trancy
“Everyone, everything is happy!” – Alois Trancy
“Hannah, don’t you think a sunny-side-up egg is pitiable? Its shell is broken and it’s forced to publicly show an indecorous appearance. Then it becomes an eyeball, internal organs, or a plume. And I rob it of any and all possibilities.” – Alois Trancy
“Then show me those eyes. Not the eyes of those villagers who looked as if they’d seen a pile of vomit. Not the old man’s greedy, inflamed eyes. That day, those eyes. Those eyes that longed only for me, Claude.” – Alois Trancy

“I am not so noble that I would stake my life for someone else. Nor am I so forgiving that I would sit by and allow someone to trample me. I am selfish… and self righteous human being! That’s why! I… to clear my own shame… I used your power. Not for anyone else! But for myself!” – Ciel Phantomhive
“If we are to die one day, wouldn’t it be better to have no regrets?” – Ciel Phantomhive

“Only two kinds of people exist in this world, those who steal and those who are stolen from.” – Ciel Phantomhive

“I … humiliated as a pet … my house was burnt, my family was killed. I was such a… powerless kid. Therefore, I returned to this place in order to make those people who put me through such fate taste the same humiliation.

I’m waiting …for them to come and try to kill me here.” – Ciel Phantomhive

“It’s in bad taste to play games that make me feel like throwing up, Demon!” – Ciel Phantomhive
“You can only disgrace the dead so much.” – Ciel Phantomhive
“You aren’t wrong. You fought to protect your world. What’s wrong with that? In the end, “justice” is just an official line taken by those in power to serve their own ends. No one’s looking out for others. If you’re careless, you’ll be robbed. There are only two kinds of people in this world. Those who steal, and those who are stolen from. And today, I steal your futures. That’s all this is.” – Ciel Phantomhive

“As long as there is the contract, I will protect your life. However, if you make a mistake of your own accord, you will possibly suffer a painful experience while alive. You already know that, don’t you?” – Sebastian Michaelis
“Honestly, how meaningless.. For something called love, which has neither meaning nor form. Laughable, isn’t it?” – Sebastian Michaelis
“For a king to survive it’s good for him to be able to skillfully manipulate the other pieces using both the knight and the queen. Beneath the throne the bodies of your pieces will pile up along with your sins. You must not lose.” – Sebastian Michaelis
“Yes…I am a demon. There’s no way I could understand my prey, a human’s sense of taste. What I understand is…only the taste of a human’s soul.” – Sebastian Michaelis
“Any game becomes boring when it lacks thrills.” – Sebastian Michaelis
“If it is your wish, I will follow you anywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust. Even if the bodies pile up endlessly above the bottomless pile of corpses. Beside you as you lie down softly, I will be, until I hear the words “Check Mate”.” – Sebastian Michaelis

“Oh, Little Sebas-chan, I do love red the most. Hair, clothes, lipstick, I love them to be red. That’s why I love using fresh blood to do make-up for those ugly women. The more flamboyant a woman is, the more she’s as beautiful as a poisonous flower, right?” – Grell Sutcliff
“A good man’s past makes people curious! But if he’s a bad man, then it makes me wanna see even more!” – Grell Sutcliff

“I’ve got to exterminate the bad rats infesting my city, don’t I? So I keep a cat. Meow!” – Lau
“That means you will steadily sink into mud. Even if you step toward a place from which you can’t return, you choose not to reveal your screaming for help to other people, eh?” – Lau
“In this world, Earl, there are people who can’t survive because of the cruelty of reality. I sell those people dreams.” – Lau
“Between being eternally unable to wake from a dream, and being eternally unable to dream, which do you think would be more unfortunate? Still, both the dream that we deemed eternal, and this very reality, are destined to end someday.” – Lau

“Ciel Phantomhive, I will pierce your soft skin with my needle… and slowly suck out your sensual soul.” – Claude Faustus

“Don’t sweat the small stuff. You’ll only tire yourself out.” – Ranta
“So now we know her past. So what? It doesn’t have anything to do with us. We have to be nice to her just because she’s had a rough past? You’ve got to be kidding.” – Ranta

“I’m a man who makes precise choices about time, place, and people. People call me Master of Choices. I’m gonna be the King of the Choices!” – Ranta
“Why do we have to be okay being friends with someone who won’t treat us as friends?” – Ranta
“You said that she’s no different from us, right? So if we don’t try to get to know her, she won’t try to get to know us either. If we don’t treat her as a friend, she won’t treat us as her friends either, right?” – Haruhiro
“Are our enemies the kobolds? No, our real enemies are our overly weak selves.” – Haruhiro
“Yeah, we’ve become friends. When you’re in the same party, there will be times when things don’t go smoothly, when you get angry, and when you fight. But they really are your precious friends. It doesn’t matter why you became friends, but that you are friends at this moment.” – Haruhiro

“If we had spent more time together, maybe I would have seen another side of him. I wish I knew him more. I wish I knew more about what kind of person he was. I wanted more time. If we had more time, we would’ve gone through things together. Maybe we would’ve gotten annoyed at each other and fight. Maybe we would’ve disliked each other, or liked each other more.” – Haruhiro
“As for me, I have a lot of things that I’m not good at and that I need to work on. My comrades make up for those weaknesses by help me out, and maybe that’s how we’ve found a balance in our party.” – Haruhiro
“We fall into a routine and make careless mistakes because of that. Maybe it’d be good for us to have some excitement or be under pressure once in a while.” – Haruhiro
“It seems like we spent a long time together, but it wasn’t. It was actually pretty short. Too short. So I kind of know, but I kind of don’t know what I want to say. He was friendly, easy to talk to, and smart. He could do anything and was reliable. I thought he was perfect. But maybe I just didn’t realize what his faults were.

“I understand the pain of losing a comrade. I’ve experienced it, too. Please do not forget the pain. You will move forward while holding on to that pain. Please treasure the comrades you have now. Once they are gone, they will not return. Usually, you don’t realize this until afterwards.” – Shinohara
“The more battles we fought, the more our confidence grew. We weren’t afraid of anything back then. But the difference between victory and defeat is paper-thin. We didn’t realize this and were arrogant.” – Hayashi

You won’t become someone.” – Lawless
“Life’s but a walking shadow. A poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. No matter how hopelessly they struggle in the light, they all die without meaning. Licht-tans’s piano skills are amazing, but see… be it you or anyone, it’s impossible to become anything. Human life is so meaningless…” – Lawless
“It’s not about wanting to do something that you can do, it’s about what you do. It’s not about wanting to become someone, it’s about who you want to become.” – Licht Jekylland Todoroki
“I had a lot of dreams as a child. I wanted many people to listen to the piano. I wanted to fly. I wanted to communicate with animals. Those dreams have all pretty much come true. Right now, I have a different dream. What mankind can imagine is what mankind can make into a reality. The imagination is a weapon. It is far superior than anything else in the world.” – Licht Jekylland Todoroki

“I’m on a little boat. I’m going against the current of the river, downstream to upstream. If you want something more, you move forward with all your might. If you try to stop, you fall behind. Humans can never stop moving. If they do not yearn for something… Right! Nothing begins without action! You gain nothing if you do nothing! Satisfaction is stagnation! Stagnation is death! I want to know! See! Feel! Experience! Understand! This monster is amazing, but we know nothing about him! This monster strength was amazing. He won every battle he fought! The ultimate soldier! Now it’s a war between vampires? I have to thank the Servamp of Melancholy! In every era, wars have created progress!” – Johannes Mimir Faustus
“I don’t want to lie anymore. The words “I believe in you” is a curse. No, it’s a spell. If the one who hears it feels cursed, they are.” – Watanuki Sakuya
“Reaching out to someone is simple. All you need is the resolve to say, “I’m your ally no matter what.” “I believe in you.” That’s all the resolve you need. It’s okay to make mistakes. I grew up by making mistakes. Don’t have any regrets. Your justice may be completely different from someone else’s. You are completely different people after all. But you still live on together. People always look for ways to do just that.” – Shirota Tooru
“What is an adult? Does coolly drinking black coffee and spouting logic make you an adult?! If that’s the case, I’ll stay a kid that likes drinking orange juice.” – Shirota Mahiru
“I was curious. Mikuni-san and Tsuyuki-senpai are the same. You say you’ll “destroy” vampires. You never say “kill”. Senpai. You’ve never seen a vampire playing games while lazing around the house, have you? A vampire crying that they’re “sorry for lying” and regretting… A really bothersome NEET vampire who fought to protect a human he had just met too! I’ve seen a lot more than just their bad sides. They’re all my comrades. You know, it’d be good if you just talked about what’s bothering you too. Neither humans nor vampires need reasons to want to protect or save something.” – Shirota Mahiru
“If I’m bad at doubting others, I’d rather believe in them! If I get tricked, I’ll think about what to do when it happens! Things are simpler that way!” – Shirota Mahiru“There’s an old saying my late grandma taught me. When you’re ten, they call you a prodigy. When you’re fifteen, they call you a genius. Once you hit twenty, you’re just an ordinary person.” – Haruka Nanase
“We’re supposed to be learning from a woman who became a teacher as plan B? I want to go home.” – Haruka Nanase

“It’s all thanks to you. You’re the one who came up with the idea of starting a swim club. I never thought I’d be swimming in a relay again. Thanks, Nagisa.” – Haruka Nanase
“The water is alive. Once you dive in, it will immediately bare its fangs and attack. But, there’s nothing to fear. Don’t resist the water. Thrust your fingers into the surface and carve an opening. Then you slide your body through that opening. Moving your arms, your head, your chest.” – Haruka Nanase
“I’ve seen this before. This sensation… I get it now. This is what I wanted. No need to rely on or work with other people. I just want to drift through the water alone in silence.” – Haruka Nanase
“You have to stop thinking you can go through life alone… Because you’re not alone.” – Haruka Nanase
“Nobody can beat you when you’re in water, Haru-chan.” – Makoto Tachibana

“He won tournaments all over the place and brought home lots of trophies and medals. His dream was to become an Olympic swimmer. But he never achieved that dream. He got married and had me. He became a fisherman. Then he died, just like that. I want to achieve the dream my dad couldn’t. And there’s someone I have to beat before I can make that happen.” – Rin Matsuoka
“As always, I can’t make any sense of you. And you’re as icy as ever. Yeah, you really piss me off.” – Rin Matsuoka
“The four of us won this together, so it doesn’t make sense for one person to take it home. So, let’s put it in a time capsule and dig it up when we’re grown up. Romantic, right?” – Rin Matsuoka“Anyway, here’s my point. Trivial setbacks like yours and mine are nothing but common occurrences in everyday life! Getting hung up over pointless crap like that shows that you’re a joke! A complete and utter joke!” – Seiya Kanie
“You guys sure are a worthless bunch. If you wanna wallow in your tears, save it for after you’ve done everything you can.” – Seiya Kanie

“I’m here because I don’t like to be tied down. So you should decide for yourself who you want for your friend.” – Hayabusa Shou
“If I have to win through underhanded means, I’d rather just stand right here until I die.” – Hayabusa Shou
“Don’t you think forcing people to help with something pointless is far more cruel?” – Fukase
“Looking back on the past is a dangerous thing. It’s nothing more than an attachment.” – Fukase
“When you aim to reach high places, you may find yourself on narrow footing and feel disheartened. And then your confidence will falter, and you will find it ever harder to believe in yourself. If you ever feel that you can’t believe in yourself, please believe in your friends.” – Sakamoto
“Mankind is a very interesting species.” – Sakamoto
“Even if they’re only a year older, shouldn’t we respect and serve our elders?” – Sakamoto
“When faced with a decision… At such times, we must choose only one option and it can be very confusing. When that happens, simply using your head and charging straight into the obstacle is a fine option.” – Sakamoto
“Accomplishing a shared goal under tense circumstances causes distance between people to naturally close.” – Sakamoto
“If you have no money, I believe all you can do is work.” – Sakamoto

“We are the sum of our memories. Erasing the memories edged in oneself is the same as losing oneself.” – Ergo Proxy
“From the perspective of others I am part of the world, but when I observe the world from my perspective I am nowhere to be found. To observe is to create perspective. I can never cease to be the point of origin from my perspective. I observe that which is not myself. This is the first principle to find.” – Ergo Proxy
“Remember. You can feel it if you hold your hand against your chest. It belongs to no one. It’s our pulse, yours and mine. This is what brings us to the truth. It’s what proves that we are the very world itself. Follow your instincts. The answer is already there.” – Ergo Proxy

“I want to live with Kai and you, Hagi, and everyone else. I’d like to give it a try.” – Saya Otonashi
“Our hearts beat in the same rhythm, so why does time flow differently for the two of us?” – Saya Otonashi
“No! That’s not true! They’ve been good friends to me, and they are part of my family. It doesn’t matter that we’re not rated by blood. Even after they found out I was a chiropteran…Riku remained my little brother! My dad remained my dad until the end.” – Saya
“Our mere existence has caused so many people sorrow and suffering. That’s why I’m going to kill you, Diva.” – Saya
“You smile, Hagi, don’t you? I had a dream. You were smiling in the dream, and I remember that I was asking you to promise me something.” – Saya Otonashi

“My, you’re trying to kill me in order to justify your existence? You’re not just selfish. You’re completely deluded.” – Diva Otonashi
“That is when we learned… that we were created by humans…. and were meant to be disposable from the beginning.” – Irene
“We had no choice but to fight in order to survive. I don’t know how long I’ve been here. But my oldest memory is feeling the restraining belts on my skin. The sunlight never reached that place. Day after day… they taught me everything there is to know about humans. And then, time to fight. It was the only time… the restraining devices were taken off of me. Day after day… I had no choice but to fight, fight and fight. Our torn skin closed up instantly… and our broken bones healed quickly. None of us died. We took it for granted. But we later learned the truth. We we could die too. We didn’t know what it was at first. Cracks on our bodies. We called it the “Thorn”. The Thorn appeared on some of the Schiff… and destroyed their bodies. We found out that those who got the Thorn… would eventually crystallize and die.” – Irene“If training hard can make you number one, then how many number ones do you think this world will have!?” – Kazuma Mikura
“So I’ll search for my real ”wings”, because if I stay in the comfort of my nest, I’ll never be able to use my own strength to fly.” – Itsuki Minami
“There’s something you can’t see unless you’re standing at the top, to experience that for the first time, I’m struggling to a higher place than anyone else, isn’t that what freedom is?” – Itsuki Minami
“Keep flying higher so that others are inspired to fly with you.” – Itsuki Minami
“Nothing can remain the same forever, because if you don’t change you can’t improve… Facing this inescapable ”reality” if you don’t grow… You’ll be crushed… For everyone to ascend and accomplish their dreams. They must grow.” – Itsuki Minami
“A long time there… There was a balloon man, right? When I first heard that story, I was so stupid that I actually enjoyed it… But really, the story was horrible. Driven solely by his dreams he used his balloons to disappear into the sky. The people watching made a big fuss about it… But no one really tried to stop it. There’s no telling where the wind will take you. And he knew that one day his fuel, his ”freedom” would run out, and he’d fall into the black ocean. To fly… that feeling is the most important thing. But instead of the dark clouds that drive people from the sky… There must be a chain to keep them grounded. The time will come, for those with the ability to fly away, while everyone else can only watch. Using their own wings, their own power… soaring as far as they can without aid. Because… Because that is what it means to fly.” – Itsuki Minami
“Let me teach you a thing. Normally the weak person’s weakness is the strong person, but the strong person’s weakness is also the weak person.” – Itsuki Minami
“Sure, it might be warm and comfortable in there… not only safe and sound, but I get all the meals too! But I’d rather be out than be trapped inside this bird cage of yours.” – Itsuki Minami

“A frog in a well does not hope to swim in the ocean, or go to dive in deep sea. What they’re looking at since they are born, isn’t the ocean, but the sky.” – Itsuki Minami
“From this day on, I don’t need freedom. As we struggle using our strength to grasp what’s above us. We will eventually reach something, that is the meaning of the word freedom.” – Ringo Noyamano
“When a person is hard to reach, someone has to extend their hand to that person to get to them, because of that dream, because they dream that freedom really exists, the roses will look up at the sky when they bloom.” – Ringo Noyamano
“The desire to fly with ”real wings” is what motivates you.” – Ringo Noyamano
“From the past… I always wanted to ask. God, why… Are you so unfair and extremely cruel? Why do you separate those who can fly… And those who cannot and bring them into existence? Why, in this one world… You made the effort to divide them into two and bring them together? In reality everyone was born with wings!.. Why didn’t I realize that until now? It’s not that those who can fly are able to fly, but that those who think of flying… Those who believe they can fly are the ones who can fly.” – Rika Noyamano
“No matter what kind of ‘strength’ you possess. There are places you can never reach no matter how hard you try. The farther it is… The higher it is…” – Rika Noyamano
“In truth everyone gets their wings the day they are born, and if one has the courage to spread those wings, then he’ll fly for sure.” – Rika Noyamano
“My plan was perfect, but there was one thing I overlooked, one factor I failed to calculate. He’s a dumbass. And there is no accounting for Dumbass…Ness.” – Akito Wanijima
“The frog in the well can’t communicate with the ocean creatures, as it knows the depth of the sky. It’s because the frog lived inside a cramped and small space, so he knows better than anyone, how precious freedom is.” – Akito Wanijima
“Then I ask you, what do you define as the beginning of the sky? At one hundred meter or even one thousand meters, it isn’t much different from right here. The sole difference is the air density and water concentration. So, this is where sky begins. Anything above the earth belongs to the domain of sky.” – Yoshitsune
“To reach the top we must crush their dreams and climb atop their shattered hopes. The will to win at any cost, to obliterate the enemy if necessary, without ambition there is no way to move up.” – Agito Wanijima“Well, dying for honor isn’t such a bad thing.

“Right, It’s too late for doubts now. There is no returning from this place I’ve come to.” – Inaho Kaizuka
“What does it take to end a war? Well, if both sides wish for peace and set aside their hatred… No. Warfare is nothing but a means of negotiation between states. Wars break out even when there is no hatred. Territory, resources, or interests that you are determined to own. Ideology, religion, pride. Wars are fought over those objectives all the time. Meaning that when those objectives are met, the war will end. That, or the war will end when the human cost outweighs the gains. Anger and hatred are only tools to tilt a war in your favor. I’m not interested in those emotions. So I wouldn’t hate anyone just because they’re Martian.” – Inaho Kaizuka
“Whether he’s our friend or not, our enemy’s enemy can be very useful.” – Inaho Kaizuka
“I don’t think that we’re enemies at the present time, but whether we’re allies… well, that’s up to you.” – Inaho Kaizuka
“Most birds fly, but there are some species of flightless birds. I suspect that Princess Asseylum might say that she find it sad that they cannot fly even though they have wings. But their inability to fly does not trouble them in the least. On the contrary, perhaps the ones to be pitied are the birds who can fly, but kept in a cage.” – Slaine Troyard
“It is a poor knight indeed who slays one who defies him. The key is to show yourself to be superior that they will not defy you in the first place.” – Slaine Troyard

“Math is like a puzzle or a game. There’s a clear answer, and you’re going on a journey to find it. But there are many ways to reach that answer. That’s why it’s so fulfilling when you find the solution. There are ways to find an answer promptly, or more freely. Even roundabout methods can bring you to a definite solution. The method may not be pretty, but when the answer you worked hard to discover is right, it makes you happy.” – Shiho Fujimiya“To get what you want, you put up with something, make an effort, learn a skill, and inspire yourself. Is that how it is with Hinazuki too? Right now… I can tell she’s enduring something. Just the opposite of me, she is pretending to be indifferent. She pretends to feel nothing, but a 10 year old girl isn’t that strong.” – Satoru Fujinuma
“The future is always blank. Only your willpower can leave footsteps there.” – Satoru Fujinuma

“Believing in someone.” That’s a weird phrase, isn’t it? After all, if you truly believed in a person, you wouldn’t need to say, “I believe you.” It’s like saying, “I believe in air.” I don’t mean to say that “believing in something” is like a lie. “Believing” is really a term of hope of wanting to believe.” – Satoru Fujinuma
“Thinking it’s your fault after the fact is just pointless.” – Fujinuma Sachiko

I want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness. There are no adults, children, classmates, teachers or my mom on that island. On that island, I can climb a tree when I want to climb, swim in the sea when I want to swim, and sleep when I want to sleep. In the island, I think about the town that I left behind. Kids go to school, as if nothing has changed. Adults go to the office, as if nothing has changed. Mom eats, as if nothing has changed. When I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief. I want to go far, far away.” – Kayo Hinazuki

“The question is what does it take to be the one in control? Money? Brains? Strategic Prowess? Of course, all three are very important.

The one in possession of information will be able to easily become the ruler of the liar game.” – Yokoya Norihiko
“That’s people for you. Trusting one another, helping one another- it’s all a fantasy. Humans are creatures that will always betray.” – Yokoya Norihiko
“The society you all live in has long since turned into the Liar Game. Still, what all of you demonstrated through this game is that ‘Believing’ is by no means, an easy path to follow. Sometimes, taking it means allowing yourself be deceived or suffering heavy damage you will not ever recover from. And yet, ‘Trust’ born when you forget your personal interests and join forces to fight against the odds together holds tremendous power.” – Artier

“The true evil is becoming apathetic about other people.” – Akiyama Shinichi
“People SHOULD be doubted… Doubting people is simply a part of trying to know them.” – Akiyama Shinichi
“A former teacher of mine, Okabe-sensei, was always saying this to me: ‘To believe people is to doubt them.’… meaning if you keep doubting people and searching what’s inside them, sooner or later you’re bound to understand something about them. And when you do, you’ll be able to entrust something to them. That is what it means to trust and believe.” – Akiyama Shinichi

“Kaneda, you’ve always been a pain in the a**, y’know. You’ve been telling me what to do since we were kids. You always treat me like a kid. You always show up and start bossing me around, and don’t you deny it!” – Tetsuo Shima
“Why do you always have to try and save me? I could handle it on my own. Yeah, I admit I’ve gotten beaten before, but I won’t always be on the receiving end, you hear that? You understand?” – Tetsuo Shima
“I want him more than dead, I’ll split his freaking head open!” – Tetsuo Shima

I knew that, but still I interpreted the stuff I didn’t understand about you in ways convenient for me… That’s just how I am.” – Shouya Ishida
“Things would have been so much better back then… If we had heard each other’s voices. I hate myself. I was selfish, and I never thought about anyone else’s feelings. Since then, my classmates have all looked down on me. I’ve lived for seventeen years, and I haven’t lived one of them as a good person. The only time I heard your voice was when we got into that fight. And what pisses me off the most is the fact that I haven’t changed at all since back then! But.,. But now, I think I can understand what you were saying… Nishimiya. Me and you… Can we be… friends? Shit!! I went way too far!! I was just gonna apologize and get out of here! Why the hell did I end up asking her to be friends?… Why did I even say that?! Jeez, that’s so embarrassing! How can you even say that?” – Shouya Ishida
“Back then, if we could have have heard each other’s voices, everything would have been so much better.” – Shouya Ishida“It’s natural to want to stay in the game world and hope the game will never end. However, I’ve learned one thing from playing all those online games. There’s nothing lonelier or sadder than the end of a game with no ending. More and more players get bored and move on to other games… And one day, even NPC’s like your favorite blacksmith or landlady disappear forever as they smile. I’ve experienced that moment and cried many, many times. That isn’t how games should end. It definitely isn’t!” – Haruyuki Arata
“We all live in the space between one moment and eternity. We meet and part. Everyone lives their lives to the fullest in a world where things change with the passage of time. But I’m sure some things won’t ever change. There are also things that change and can never be gotten back. But we already know. Even if things change, they’ll begin anew. And as long as we have the will, humans will always move on forward. For we can accelerate.” – Haruyuki Arata
“Strength isn’t just about winning. Even if my attempts are pathetic and comical, and even if I’m covered in the mud of my defeat, if I can keep fighting and look up at the sky as I lie on the ground, that alone is proof of true strength!” – Haruyuki Arata

“You are really red. It would be fun to hang you from a traffic light, and stop cars.” – Kuroyukihime
“I envy you. You’ve been betrayed and hurt, yet you can still forgive each other. I envy you for having such a great friend.” – Kuroyukihime“People don’t fall in love based on looks. And that’s a scientific fact.” – Ichijou Kagetsu
“Sometimes, I wonder why people fall in love. Why do we abandon ourselves… to these painful and burdensome feelings?” – Nejima Yukari
“Even though you like someone already, your partner is decided for you… and you can’t do anything about that crush. Because everyone keeps getting in the way… and saying you can’t… But… when you’re the one in love… the only thing that feels true… is that feeling.” – Nejima Yukari
“If you take someone at puberty, a teen… introduce him or her to a member of the opposite sex around the same age and say, “This is the person who was meant for you”… and then go on to spend a lot of time together… why wouldn’t you fall for them?” – Nisaka Yuusuke
“Just your touch… gets me excited. It makes me so happy. But those feelings will all turn into pain. The happier I am now, the more it’ll hurt. I know how cruel this is… but no matter how hard I try, I can’t rid myself of this. Nejima-kun… I… don’t know… what love is.” – Takasaki Misaki
“What is love? Its when your eyes start following someone, and you look for them if they’re not around. You get excited thinking you might run into him when you’re putting your shoes on in the morning. And when you don’t it’s a little disappointing. But then you pass by him and that makes you happy for the rest of the day. It feels like you can handle anything. Seeing him is enough to make you happy.” – Takasaki Misaki
“I don’t really want you to understand… I just don’t want you to be like, ‘Oh, is that all’? I don’t need people to get it. These feelings… are important to me, and they’re just for me.” – Takasaki Misaki“I won’t be defeated because I know how awful it feels to lose after doing my very best!” – Sho Kazamatsuri
“Why do I want to win so much…? Everyone takes up soccer for different reasons. But we all have a passion for the sport… That drive carries us through a game, even if we lose. If we win, it pushes us forward to the next game. The winners of the game honour the losers by playing with everything they have… and until we hit a wall, until a better team beats us, we should try our best, instead of running away. That’s what I want to do!” – Sho Kazamatsuri
“Each one of them has something to improve. Victory doesn’t come from technique or power alone. In the end, what’s needed is a heart that won’t give up. The only question is — Do they have what it takes to push beyond their limits?” – Soujuu Matsushita
“It’s okay to make mistakes. In fact, you should. Making mistakes is how you learn to do it right. Getting a good result isn’t the only thing. What matters is that you play your best during the game.” – Soujuu Matsushita
“Charging from the front isn’t the only way to cross a wall. If pushing doesn’t work, why not try pulling? Try thinking from the opposite direction, you might be able to find a new way out.” – Kou Kazamatsuri

“I do want to be useful for something and to be of help to people, but I want to decide what that “something” is by myself.” – Kawai Maria
“The spell always breaks in the end. Girls will always transform back into their original shabby form. After that, you only have your own strength to rely on to accomplish anything.” – Kawai Maria

“No matter how ugly something is, if you look at it in a cute way, it’ll seem dear somehow.” – Kawai Maria
“I’m not very good at sensing people’s boundaries. Without knowing how far is too far, I gradually get closer and closer. It’s terrifying. Being unable to sense that is terrifying.” – Kawai Maria
“I always wished to be accepted by my surroundings. I tried to change myself for that reason. But, I don’t care if I’m disliked. I don’t care if I don’t have a place where I belong.

“I have to accept that who I want to become and who I can actually become are different.” – Kawai Maria
“Ever since I was little, I’ve always been curious. Why doesn’t the witch, who can use her magic to transform a shabby girl into someone lovely, cast a spell on herself? If she used her magic on herself, she could become lovely too. The witch does not use her magic on herself because she knows the emptiness that follows when the spell breaks.” – Kawai Maria

“Wrongly placed jealousy is ugly when it goes too far.” – Kawai Maria

“I’ll pump you full of holes!” – Aria H. Kanzaki
“You’re just like the rest of them. Nobody ever believes anything I say. Like, right now, I can sense that an enemy is closing in on Shirayuki. I’m not anything like my great-grandfather. I don’t have the words to explain it logically. That’s why they call me the “Defective Holmes”, the one who didn’t get the gift. But I know that I’m right this time!” – Aria H. Kanzaki

“The Ulus have a saying: A wolf cannot become a dog…And a dog can never become a wolf…Wolves and dogs can cross. They can even have offspring. But…A wolf is always a wolf, but a dog can never go back to being a dog. If it follows a wolf away from the safety of human habitation and migrates to the cruel forest, the dog, carrying its innate weakness, will exhaust its life…So a wolf should only spend time with another wolf.” – Reki
“Hello! I’m the cute little sister that takes care of her Onii-chan from ‘Good Morning’ until ‘Good Night’.” – Kaname Tohyama
“Little sisters are best. Nothing comes in between a brother and his younger sister. These bonds are absolute, completely unlike any other relationship with girls!” – Kaname Tohyama
“Well…I believe in you.” – Kaname Tohyama
“Thanks are illogical. That’s what a little sister is supposed to do.” – Kaname Tohyama“Once you get used to the abnormalities, they become mundane.” – Leonardo Watch
“When things seem beyond help, if you open your eyes and take a really good look… It’s a lot better than turning your back and hiding your eyes.” – Leonardo Watch
“You’ve always seen yourself as just a normal kid, and you’re right, that’s exactly what you are. You’re normally caring, normally cheerful, and you’re normally nosy. You’ve a strong moral compass, concern for your friends, and honor. I know you don’t see this, but what’s normal to you, well it’s far from it. Everyone else would call it courageous and noble. It’s because of the person you are that you don’t think twice about your own safety when it comes to helping your friends. ‘Cause that’s just normal to you.” – Zed O’Brien
“Death is a privilege of the living. A destiny without reason, continually roving on, evermore. How fleeting a thing it is. One cannot live and forget about death. The despair that is me, forgotten by death, can at least embrace my yearning at twilight, and sleep.” – William Macbeth
“Everyone thinks at some point if what they are doing has any meaning or not. Will the day come when I get what’s coming to me, or not? How much influence does my existence have on the world at all, or doesn’t it?” – William Macbeth
“Me? A liar? That’s almost hurtful. I just don’t feel like telling the whole truth.” – William Macbeth

“People are weak. Because of their weakness, they sometimes behave in ways devoid of self-respect. But then, so what if they do, my old friend? Even if I am struck with a thousand setbacks… it does not serve as a reason to alter the way I live… my life!” – Klaus Von Reinherz
“Step one foot outside, and with one pull of a trigger, you can inflict a fatal injury; with one push of a button, you can blow up a whole lot of people at once. The world truly is a cavalcade of efficiency in violence. Still… whether hacking each other with stone axes, cutting each other with swords, shooting each other with guns, cursing each other with magic, or taking aim at each other with missiles, for some reason, there’s a craving that grips us, from which we can’t evolve away.” – Klaus Von Reinherz
“Even now, twenty centuries after the death of Christ, the world is a long way from peace.” – Mary Macbeth
“Everyone dies eventually, whether they have power or not. That’s why you need to think about what you’ll accomplish while you’re alive.” – Mary Macbeth
“Don’t you think it’s futile to live in fear of death? I mean, everyone is going to die sometime, so is there any point in pretending not to see it for the present? Or instead, I wonder if they think it doesn’t concern them, since they aren’t going to die.” – Mary Macbeth“There are times humans can’t back down from a fight.” – Shinichi Izumi
“If talking won’t resolve matters, maybe inflicting some pain will.” – Shinichi Izumi
“Maybe humans are the closest thing to demons alive.” – Shinichi Izumi
“In the end, I couldn’t see things from the parasites’ perspective, never mind from Migi’s. Of course not. It wasn’t possible from the beginning. As two different species, we may at times take advantage of each other and kill each other, but it’s impossible to understand each other. Actually, you shouldn’t even think that you’ve figured out another species based on your standards. I think it’s human arrogance to think we understand how other life forms feel. There may be no other life forms that are truly a “friend” to man. Still, even if we can’t comprehend them, they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect.” – Shinichi Izumi
“When you feel your life’s on the line, your true nature surfaces.” – Shinichi Izumi
“Human life is precious isn’t it?” – Shinichi Izumi
“It hurts so much … I can barely speak from the grief, yet I have no tears.” – Shinichi Izumi
“You shouldn’t mouth off when you don’t know sh**” – Shinichi Izumi
“You all underestimate humans. Individually, they may appear weak, but that is not the case. What we need to recognize is that humans are a single life-form comprised of millions of individuals. Besides their individual brains, humans possess a different “brain” of enormous magnitude. The moment we act in opposition to that brain, we will lose.” – Tamura Reiko
“I’ve been thinking… for a long while. For what purpose was I born into this world? Whenever I resolved one question, another would arise in its place. I sought the beginning. I sought the end. I’ve just been walking and walking, thinking all the while. Perhaps nothing will change, no matter how far I go. If I’m to stop my journey, that is fine, too. Even if I were informed that everything has reached its end, I’d just accept it. But even so, I found an answer to yet another of my questions today.” – Tamura Reiko
“You sacrifice other lives so that your own life can continue. That is how animals live. Humans are one-of-a kind creatures that commit suicide.” – Migi
“Shinichi, upon researching the concept of demons, I believe that, among all life, humans are the closest thing to it. Although humans kill and eat a wide variety of life forms, my kind eat merely one or two kinds at most. We are quite frugal in comparison.” – Migi
“Flies know how to fly without being taught. Spiders know how to spin webs without being taught. Why is that? Here’s what I think: Flies and spiders are simply following an order. I believe all lives on Earth have received orders of some kind. Don’t humans have any directive? When I took over this human’s brain, I received a directive. It said, Devour this species.” – Ryoko Tamiya
“Why are humans so irrational.” – Ryoko Tamiya“People aren’t complicated. We work hard when we know that we’ll get something in return, and we try to work even harder if that something is our own improvement.” – Kumiko Oumae
“It’s a lie that the Gods smile upon people who make an effort.” – Kumiko Oumae
“When you can’t play well, I think it hurts a lot more than people think.” – Kumiko Oumae
“They music vanishes once it’s played and that you can never take it back. You always have to play like you mean it.” – Kawashima Sapphire
“I believe music is a powerful language that speaks to people’s hearts, no matter where you are in the world.” – Kawashima Sapphire
“All music begins with love, of course. Love and death are timeless themes of music. It isn’t an overstatement to say that those are every piece’s genesis.” – Kawashima Sapphire
“Music isn’t supposed to be something you do to show off your abilities to your rivals.” – Noboru Taki
“We all face the same direction, and we all work hard. Otherwise there’s no point. Do we have to work hard, while we get angry at the people who don’t care.” – Katou Hazuki
“You know, if you’re alone, you never have the courage to do something about it, and you end up thinking about it forever.” – Katou Hazuki
“I guess you don’t necessarily like the things you’re good at.” – Nakagawa Natsuki
“Everyone’s hiding their true feelings and going with the popular choice because it’s safe.” – Aoi Satou

“I want to become special. I don’t want to become the same as others.” – Kousaka Reina
“A lot of people say you can’t really judge music using only gold, silver or bronze. When bad players say it, I think it’s nothing more than sour grapes. So, in the end, the only thing to do is to get good.” – Kousaka Reina
“I don’t try to get close to people who don’t interest me. Being relieved to know you’re the same as someone else is stupid. I want to resist going along with all those perfect people.” – Kousaka Reina“Just because my reasoning is childish and wrong, and just because my argument can be easily defeated with a bit of cleverness, does not mean your reasoning is completely correct.” – Kamijou Touma
“If you want to do something and have the power for it, then do it!” – Kamijou Touma
“I don’t need a reason to save someone.” – Kamijou Touma
“As long as no one got hurt, it’s all good. Who cares who saved who?” – Kamijou Touma
“Success comes only to those who have dared to stand up without fear!” – Kamijou Touma
“This is your life right? Then decide for yourself! If you want to protect everything with your hands then do so, if you want to abandon everything then do so. But, what do you yourself want to do right now? Can you really be satisfied giving someone else that you don’t really understand your most important thing?” – Kamijou Touma
“Opportunities and success come only to those who do not fear to stand in the batter’s box. Who want to hit the ball more than anything, and swing with all their might!” – Kamijou Touma
“God, if this world, this story, is moving ahead according to the system you created… then I first need to destroy that illusion!” – Kamijou Touma
“Is it that you get the power, then you choose to protect someone else? No! We first want to protect someone, that’s why we try to get stronger in the first place.” – Kamijou Touma
“The same thing as always. No matter how many times I reach game over and no matter how many times I must pathetically hit continue, I will not stop moving forward.” – Kamijou Touma
“Things like heroes are unnecessary. Can’t you save someone if you’re standing right there, at that very spot? In front of your eyes are people that don’t wish to cry that are crying! In front of your eyes are people that can only clench their teeth while struggling and can’t even say the words “please save me”! Is that not enough?” – Kamijou Touma
“Really, what’s with that? Such a power doesn’t even appear in Academy City’s databank. If I am a 1-in-328,571 prodigy, then aren’t you, the only one in Academy City, a 1-in-2,300,000 disaster?” – Mikoto Misaka
“You don’t need a good reason to save a friend. If you want to save them, then save them. I know someone who kept saying those stupid things even when he was driven to the brink of death, and he really did save over 10,000 people in the end. And that idiot that saved so many people is trying to save someone today like always. I know I can’t stop him. No matter how much I don’t want him to do anything dangerous, seeing him off with a push to the back is the sign of a good woman!” – Mikoto Misaka
“If one side is putting all their efforts into killing a normal high school student and the other side is putting all their efforts into saving that normal high school student, which side do you want to be on? Which side could you proudly say you were on?” – Mikoto Misaka
“What you learn at your school is more important than where you go to school.” – Mikoto Misaka
“I’ve only just started to understand it myself. That by depending on others, and letting them depend on you, people can exceed what they can do as individuals.” – Mikoto Misaka
“The Idealist says, everyone is born equal. We are all of equal worth. The sportsman screams, no effort goes unrewarded. Work hard for your dreams! It’s about how you play the game. Obviously all untrue.” – Haruki Aritomi
“I’m too naive. With thoughts like “If I saved someone maybe I can start all over again.” – Accelerator
“Listen, even if someone is suffering before you, the kind of person that can take up arms without hesitation to shoot down the villain is no better than a villain himself. The kind that doesn’t care about others, doesn’t give 2nd chances; someone that kills if given a reason, is definitely not a hero. You don’t have to become that kind of person. That’s my specialty. Only I have to go through that.” – Accelerator
“The worst part about being strong is that no one ever asks if you’re ok.” – Accelerator
“They may all look the same to you, but there are different kinds and different levels of evil. A first-class villain doesn’t target honest lives.” – Accelerator
“I have no interest in being a villain, and I don’t think that I can become a good person. I’m at a halfway point where I’m not even sure which path I should walk down… but I guess even there, I can still interfere in someone’s life and help bring things to a positive conclusion.” – Accelerator
“The second humans lose their comfort zone, the more simplistic their actions become.” – Accelerator
“I strive for something beyond the strongest, that challenging me would be the most ridiculous thought ever, that fighting me would be a sin!” – Accelerator
“Listen up, kid. There’s one thing you need to understand. Human life is a fragile thing. So weak that I can destroy it with a touch of my finger. So watch what you say. If you don’t, I may break something I shouldn’t.” – Accelerator
“Just because I’ve gotten weaker, it doesn’t mean that you’ve gotten stronger, right?” – Accelerator
“And the unbreaking bonds will… The bonds will… Ah, what was it? Ah, well. There was a bunch of stuff about the unbreakable bonds that you’ll have to deal with while your guts overflow! Show the results of your everyday training and guts! Show off that splendor and guts to those weaklings without it! To make this tournament the best memory ever! By overcoming all sorts obstacles through trial and hardship and getting up everytime we fall down!” – Sogiita Gunha
“A sin, once committed, is never forgotten. It haunts you for all eternity.” – Shinobu Nunotaba“It’s troublesome if the villain doesn’t show their evil. Villains are necessary to make knights into heroes.” – Helbram
“Everyone has to die someday. But what they believed in will never fade away as long as someone protects it. Once you’ve resolved to take on those principles, no matter how much blood and tears you shed, you follow through with it! That’s what it means to be a knight.” – Meliodas
“Anyone who doesn’t appreciate a good quality booze, doesn’t deserve to drink it.” – Meliodas

“It’s fine, if something happens I’ll come running!” – Meliodas
“No matter what lies you tell, you can’t fool your own heart.” – Meliodas
“Whenever you feel like you can’t win and there’s nobody around to lean on, just say these magic words. Sure, I am more powerful than any of the other seven deadly sins!” – Meliodas
“You threw away everything precious to you in exchange for that worthless power you are about to lose! That is your sin!” – Meliodas

“Let’s go! We’ve got a battle to fight!” – Meliodas
“Can’t you tell when your elder is trying to be nice?” – Meliodas
“Gil risked his life for the girl he loved, so putting my life on the line is just me being a good buddy.” – Meliodas
“I wanted to protect everything. But I failed, and that’s the sin I bare. So this time, I can’t fail to protect them!” – Meliodas
“That guy’s amazing! Everything he says is sexual!” – Meliodas
“Hurry up and kill me. So the one you love will come back to life.” – Meliodas
“For the sake of all the people who always fought at my side. This war that has been raging on for 3000 years. I’ll put an end to it once and for all.” – Meliodas
“If you just look at it as part of the foreplay, it’s actually not that bad at all!” – Meliodas
“What I desire is a heart… A heart that understands emotions.” – Gowther
“When some things contradict each other, you should look at the opposite side of everything. And when the meanings behind the seemingly unnatural actions are made clear, a completely different answer might be reached… Justice can become evil. Reality can become an illusion. Meaning can be found in something that appears meaningless. Think. And find the answer for yourselves. A human ceases to be once he or she stops thinking.” – Merlin“It’s kind of scary, isn’t it? To see something change so suddenly before your eyes.” – Shiori Asagiri
“You know, I was always watching you three in the gym. You always look like you’re having so much fun. I was so happy that we were put in the same class.” – Shiori Asagiri
“You can’t always hold on to the things that are important. By letting them go we gain something else.” – Kunio Yaobi

“Tamako. I’m in love with you. I’m madly in love with you!” – Mochizou Oji

“No matter where you go, no matter who you’re with, I’m fine so as long as you’re happy. Not just me, but everyone in the shopping district thinks so, too.” – Mochizou Oji
“It’s like… if someone took my teddy bear away from me.” – Midori Tokiwa
“Seeing you like this… doesn’t make me exactly happy, either.” – Midori Tokiwa
“Is mochi life, or is life mochi?” – Kanna Makino
“Anyone can love anyone they want.” – Kanna Makino
“Mochi is so small, yet it makes all kinds of people happy. I’m like several times bigger than mochi now, but I still can’t compare. It’s soft… white, gentle, smells good, and warms you up.” – Tamako Kitashirakawa
“uh? It’s Mochizō! What’s wrong? …You couldn’t make it to the toilet? Poor you.” – Tamako Kitashirakawa

“Everyday was the same. Deep down, I felt bored. But it wasn’t the days that felt boring. It was being just like everyone else.” – Sorata Kanda
“I haven’t done anything yet. Getting depressed and losing confidence is way too egotistical.” – Sorata Kanda
“I pretended it was someone else’s fault that nothing happened. But I was wrong. If you put your mind to it, you can change the color of your world in an instant.” – Sorata Kanda
“A normal person looks away from what they don’t want to see, even though they know there are things they can only acquire if they face the things they hate.” – Sorata Kanda
“Opportunities wait for no one! If you let an opportunity slip through your fingers with an excuse like, “I wasn’t prepared.” You’ll never get another opportunity like that again! But it is your life. Live it the way you want.” – Sorata Kanda
“This area feels weird, it’s been throbbing hard since that time. When you told me not to go. When you held me so tight. It won’t go away. Your voice is still in my ear. What happened to me? Is this… love?” – Mashiro Shiina
“It’s more interesting when the future’s uncertain.” – Mashiro Shiina
“You know, with talented people… They draw people to themselves, and without even trying to, they tear them to shreds. The closer you are to them, the more viciously you’ll be torn apart. They’re living in a completely different world above us. One that us normal people can’t reach. In a world that we’ll never see. A world above the clouds. That’s the kind of world they live in.” – Jin Mitaka

“To create something that appeals to the emotions of users, you need to make something that sways your own heart. You can’t move others hearts, unless you can move your own.” – Kazuki Fujisawa
“Sometimes, your future is already set, and there’s nothing you can do about it. There are some things you just can’t change, no matter how hard you work. Unfair, don’t you think? It isn’t an easy fact to accept, and I’m not telling you to, but that’s just how life is. Unfair.” – Kazuki Fujisawa
“The best way to write a realistic romance is to first be in love. Everyone can write a love story from their life.” – Lida Ayano“Every morning, when I wake up, the first thought I have is: “I wonder if I still have my body.” What a relief! It still works. I can’t describe in words how wonderful it is to have a body that works. I love my life at the Social Welfare Agency very much.” – Rico
“Is a girl with a mechanical body ordinary? I’m super strong and can kill a man with my bare hands. I do bleed, but the pain goes away fast. Since I’m a cyborg and have to protect Jose… I can’t be an ordinary girl.” – Henrietta

“I’ve been training you to look after yourself. But seeing how you’ve become… it’s got me worried. You can’t just pull the trigger, Claes. You have to think.

“People who don’t work hard don’t have the right to be envious of the people with talent. People fail because they don’t understand the hard work necessary to be successful.” – Yukino Yukinoshita
“If what I wished for was granted to me, if what I wanted was given to me. Then, as I thought, I wouldn’t wish for anything nor want anything. Because the things you were granted and the things you were given were surely shams that would one day be lost. The things you wished for had no shape and the things you wanted were untouchable. Or possibly, they might be the most wonderful treasures that would become nothing if you were to touch them.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“If wishes could be granted, if desires could be fulfilled, then I wouldn’t wish or desire for anything after all. The things you’re handed on a silver platter are never genuine, and never everlasting. And that is why I’ll always keep searching.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I want to reply with a long message, but if it’s too long, that might be kind of revolting. But if it’s too short, then I might come off as cold instead. Feeling apprehensive of what to do, I decided to reply back with a similar word count instead. This was what they called “mirroring” in psychology. By emulating the actions of the other party, your affection levels would increase!” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Yeah, I’m being stupid. I know that it’s out of question. I know how this will end. I’ll be left with nothing. Even so, I want us to think, writhe, struggle… and find… something genuine.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Well it’s not like the world is full of sunshine and daisies. If society was only shaped by the view that one must be happy-go-lucky all the time, Hollywood wouldn’t make tear-jerking movies, would they?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“A lone warrior surviving hundreds of battles, when it comes to losing, I’m the strongest.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Youth is both a lie and a form of evil.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Really, what a joke. I just didn’t understand what these nice guys were thinking about. Because they were so in love with everyone getting along, they ended up opening up other problems when they try to fix one. I didn’t even ask to be thrown into that circle either.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I’m not highly aware. I’m highly self-aware.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are no inherently bad people. Everyone believes that, myself included. I don’t doubt the existence of virtue. And yet people bare their fangs when it seems they can profit. People will rationalize their own behavior whenever they become tainted with evil; they’re not supposed to be evil. In order to preserve their own twisted integrity, the world becomes twisted. Someone you praised as “cool” until yesterday is “stuck up” today; someone you respected as “smart and knowledgeable” is now scorned as someone who “looks down on bad students”, and “energetic vigor” becomes “annoying and overly carried away”.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“It doesn’t matter if we’re wrong…because every time we go wrong, we’ll continue to look for the right answer.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“It is better to be hated for what you are, than to be loved for what you are not.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Do you know the phrase “enough specks of dust creates a mountain”? Or maybe “three heads are better than one.” In other words, when people gather together, they become even stronger and more secure. However, we were a group of failures who had gathered to do pointless things.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Everyone is a slave to their past. No matter how much you wish to move forward, the events of last year will bear down on you like the light of the stars as soon as you glance up. Unable to laugh or to banish your past, you carry it ceaselessly in a corner of your heart, waiting for it to resurrect at an inopportune moment.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“The Devil’s finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There was no meaning to things that were only superficial. That was a single belief that both me and her once shared.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“When people reach the halfway mark of a long ordeal, how do they feel? Does being only halfway there make them despair? Or do they feel relief at making it halfway there? Most people have to feel one way or the other, and both emotions create an opening in their hearts. That’s why I pushed myself this far.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“As they say about the vulgar masses, the more people flock to a group, the more foolish they become. No matter how prominent an individual is, no, it’s because he is prominent that he would be blotted out by the sheer force of numbers when thrown into that lump of people. Individual will, qualifications, and personality, let alone emotions aren’t considered at all. We see only what we want to see, listen only to what we want to listen to, but for the things we want to say, we aren’t able to. This is the society that we’re living in right now.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“You can’t take back the answer you already gave out. There’s no use in crying over spilt milk. The egg you broke won’t come back. All the horses and soldiers of a king will never return to his side again. It doesn’t matter what was said. You can never wipe away a bad impression. Even though the opposite is so simple in comparison. Just one word will make someone appear hateful. Just doing one thing would make you seem hateful. That’s why excuses are meaningless. Because even those excuses will make you look hateful.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Expecting others to read your mind is delusional.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“It’s arrogant to think just saying things out loud is enough. Self-gratifying on the part of the speaker, and conceited on the part of the listener. You won’t always come to an understanding by talking things out.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are people who ruin the atmosphere just by existing, you know.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“We all have our own personal image that’s dictated by others, one that’s always off the mark. We wish to remain true to ourselves, but who gets to decide who we are as people? When our image never goes hand-in-hand with reality, where can we find something genuine? Where can we find our true selves?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“So long as a problem doesn’t cause problems, it can’t be called a problem.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“What if, and this is strictly hypothetical, what if you could reload your save data to change your previous choice, like in a game? Would it change your life? The answer is a resounding no.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are people who can’t act unless they’re faced with a problem. Unless they find their reason. All I was left with was the sinking suspicion that I’d gone horribly wrong.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Don’t put me on their level. I don’t care about looking interesting. I’m just self-conscious.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“That’s not exactly right. If you had to sacrifice many things to protect one, you’re more likely to give up and throw it away. Including relationships you have in your hand now.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There are some people who don’t want a solution. Some want things to stay the way they are. There’s no way to make things convenient for everyone. So the only option is to find a compromise.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Having people acknowledge your existence is a wonderful thing.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“When a girl calls someone a “nice guy”, it means she couldn’t care less about him.” – Hachiman Hikigaya

“If there are things you learn with friends, there must also be things you learn without friends. They must be of equal worth, two sides of the same coin.” – Hachiman Hikigaya

“A wandering soul in isolation, has no need for a place to belong.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Relying on someone, helping each other out, and supporting each other. Most would say that’s the right thing to do. However, that’s just idealistic. In reality, someone always gets the short end of the stick.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“What does someone who´s lost their standing want the most? That’s simple. They want someone to find them, where they’re standing.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Excuses are meaningless. The tougher things get, the more likely people are to come to their own conclusions.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“There is a history to humans. Humans are shaped by the experience obtained from living as time continued to wind and wind. To be reborn meant being rid of that history; complete annihilation. However, that just wasn’t possible in reality. That’s why the only thing you could do was to continue living on, bearing the scars on your body and holding the weight of the sins on your back, without wishing for reincarnation.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“They say that if you change yourself, you’ll change the world. but that’s a complete lie. They’re just forcing you to compromise, by feeding you a convenient little fib.” – Hachiman Hikigaya

“I don’t believe in crap like coincidence, fate, or destiny.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“School trips are simply a simulation of adult social life. If you ever go on a business trip with your boss, you won’t get to choose where to stay or what to eat, but if you compromise, you can still have a modicum of fun. School trips train you to trick yourself into that kinda mindset.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Everyone has something they hold dear, something they never want to lose. That’s why they pretend. That’s why they hide the truth. And that’s why they lie.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Food tastes best when you don’t have to work for it.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Marriage, the institution where one’s existence goes to die. All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying “I’m home!” to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say “I’m home!” if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say “I’m home!” to the hippos on the label. And if they’re talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they’re working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“The past makes you wanna die out of regret and future makes you depressed out of anxiety. So by elimination, the present is likely the happiest time.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“One ought to experience loneliness at least once or twice in life. No, you have to experience it. The idea of being chained to another person without reprieve is far more abnormal and disquieting. One has no choice but to learn about loneliness. I’m sure some things can’t be experienced without it.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“About marriage or about future, I don’t know what will happen in the future. In this world, it’s normal that when there’s a preparation, then a new grief is born, but everyone has the right to desire happiness. Our efforts need to be held for the sake of our future.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Working hard alone doesn’t assure you that you’ll achieve your dreams. Actually there are more cases where you don’t. Even so, working hard and achieving something is some consolation at least.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I like myself. I have never once hated myself. My high specs, my half-decent looks, my pessimistic, realist point of view… I don’t hate any of it at all.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“I’ve forged my own way alone. While you were consoling and fighting with one another, I faced everything myself, head on. Now look at how strong I am.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“When humans are faced with truly terrifying circumstances, they don’t think about other people around them. They’re even willing to sacrifice those around themselves. By exposing that unsightly part of them, they can no longer get along.” – Hachiman Hiigaya
“You can’t run away” is an ideal for the strong. You’re not always wrong. Society, the world, the people around you – often someone else is in the wrong. To think that you can change is adapting to this cruel, indifferent, trashy world. It’s admitting defeat and servility. You’re simply deceiving yourself by dressing it up with pretty words.” – Hachman Hikigaya
“Isn’t changing yourself the same as running away? Why can’t you just accept who you are?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“People who grow up in different environments will invariably have different tastes and preferences. Therefore, could one say that the subsequent marriages necessarily lead to happiness?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“If the truth is a cruel mistress, then a lie must be a nice girl.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Now that just looks horrible. It’s like some feudal society. If that’s what it takes to make friends in this world, forever alone is fine by me.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Is it wrong to do stuff by yourself? If someone worked hard on their own until now, why do they have to face rejection here?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Your impression of people is renewed every day. As you spend time with them and grow with them, you come to understand more.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“People usually don’t look back to see how far they’ve come while they’re still walking. Of course, when they come to a standstill, the more progress they’ve made, the more betrayed they feel by their expectations.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“The present isn’t everything, but there are things you can only do now, things you can only find here. It’s now or never.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“Getting into trouble is not a bad thing. It’s proof that someone is watching you.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“Trying to not hurt others is something you can’t do. People are creatures who hurt others just by existing even if they’re not aware of it. Whether you’re living or dying, you’ll always be hurting someone. Once you’re involved, you’ll hurt someone, and even by not being involved, you might be hurting someone else as well.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“Don’t understand? Then think more. If you can only think by calculating, then keep doing so until you can’t. Think of all the answers you can and destroy them one by one with the process of elimination. Whatever remains is your answer.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“It is impossible to not hurt someone. Humans unconsciously hurt others by simply existing. Whether you are alive or dead, you keep hurting people. Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved might hurt them too. But if it’s someone you don’t care about, you won’t notice you’ve hurt them. What’s important is your awareness of it. It’s because you care about them, that you feel like you’ve hurt them. Caring about someone means being resolved to the fact that you’ll hurt them. The more people care for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But that’s not something to be sad about, I think it’s probably something to be proud of.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“If you could calculate feelings, then we’d be in a digital age by now… The remaining answer that you couldn’t calculate is what they call the feelings of people.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“A person’s mentality and feelings aren’t always equal. There are times the conclusion you arrive at is completely irrational and the reason is because of that.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“People’s thoughts don’t always mirror how they feel. That’s why they sometimes make decisions that seem nonsensical.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka“It’s not about what you should do, it’s about what you want to do.” – Takeshi Yamamoto

“It’s not that I can’t drink, I just choose not to.” – Hibari Kyoya
“To increase the flame of the ring is to be pissed off.” – Hibari Kyoya
“Pride is not something you can surrender.” – Hibari Kyoya
“The word “discipline” is something that I would never give up, no matter what. But it’s not because it is my pride that I will not give it up. It’s because I cannot give it up, that’s why it is my pride.” – Hibari Kyoya
“You cannot restrain me with logic.” – Hibari Kyoya
“There is nothing less amusing than destroying those who have no will to live.” – Hibari Kyoya
“If you can no longer believe in the person you love, then test him until you are satisfied.” – Bianchi

I couldn’t have accomplished anything by standing still, without anybody’s help. I treasure every moment I have spent here. Unlucky? I feel pretty lucky. This is my resolve.” – Tsunayoshi Sawada
“It’s not an issue of what you should do, it’s an issue of what you want to do.” – Yamamoto Tsuyoshi
“I said smile! Smile damn you!” – Ryohei Sasagawa
“You have already fulfilled my expectations. It appears that you’re still hiding a wealth of potential. I was watching you while your Guardians struggled to overcome their trials, and I could tell from your behavior and actions that you were always putting them first. And that didn’t change when Daemon set his trap. I witnessed your resolve to protect your Family, and I was impressed. Your Guardians also responded similarly. Sawada Tsunayoshi, I deem you worthy as boss of the tenth-generation Vongola Family.” – Vongola Primo

“Bel-senpai, can you pull the knives out of my back first? Your renowned knives have such a weird shape, it’s kind of embarrassing to have them sticking out my back like this.” – Fran
“You know, I’ve been thinking, senpai, your head isn’t really screwed on right. You were probably chased out of your homeland, right?” Fran
“You should just do as you please, like you always do.” – Hayato Gokudera

“These days, I feel more comfortable in dark places. I look at these shadows as a part of you. They absorb all the light. There’s no one in the world who has this color but you.” – Shinra Kishitani
“He may seem cold-blooded, but he’s more human and his heart is more brittle than anyone else… so much so that if you filled it with human love or betrayal, it’d break easily… which is why I think he chose to avoid it all from the start: to love humanity. Do you understand? Not to accept it, not to face it, but he chose to avoid it.” – Shinra Kishitani
“If there’s any possibility that I might visit this city again…Then I challenge you to a duel. I wish to speak with you head-on, to within an inch of my life…To actually experience the joy of existing in this world…that is my desire.” – Vorona
“Love. I myself have never loved another person. Most likely, I don’t even love myself. I do have knowledge of it. But I am incapable of determining whether or not it is vital in my life.” – Vorona
“A city far away from my homeland. There, after becoming acquainted with strangers, have I changed, perhaps? That uncontrollable impulse I harbored within me…Has it faded away now, I wonder? What exactly am I doing here in this city?” – Vorona
“You just went for my head, didn’t you? You know you could kill someone by hitting a vital spot in their head, right? If you know this, then you were trying to kill me, right? So whatever I do next is what you deserve, right?” – Shizuo Heiwajima
“Look, you. All this talk about monsters…that’s what people have called me ever since I was a kid. I’ve snapped and lost sight of everything around me, and I’ve made trouble for Celty more than once or twice. Even so, she still heard me out, without interrupting. And so now it’s my turn to hear her out, all right?” – Shizuo Heiwajima
“I really hate violence … I just want to get stronger, strong enough so that someday I can contain my anger.” – Shizuo Heiwajima
“Look, all it means is that when I lose it, it’s cause things make no sense. If there was any logic to it, then I wouldn’t get pissed even if I got shot or stabbed.” – Shizuo Heiwajima
“What is life?”, “Why do people live?”. Someone asked me that and I beat him within an inch of his life…” – Shizuo Heiwajima

“Let’s say I posed this question to you: “Can all human souls be bought with money or not?” Now remember, the keyword here is “all”. The answer is “There are times when you can buy them, and other times, not,” right? The human being… sometimes he’ll uphold his pride and conscience even if he’s offered ten billion yen, and other times he’ll murder someone over one yen.” – Izaya Orihara
“Dying means to be gone. And what goes, is not your pain, but your existence itself. But in your mind, you think that you’d have a sense of “nothing” after you die. How can you call that “nothing”? In other words, you don’t even have an idea of what death is really like.” – Izaya Orihara
“To enjoy an ordinary life, you must constantly evolve.” – Izaya Orihara
“You know how they have parameters in games? Like, you’re good at magic, but your combat skills blow, or you’re a great fighter, but you lack in the brains department.” – Izaya Orihara
“Have you ever thought about why you’re so good and your parents are so bad? If you’d so kindly let me give away the answer; it’s because even if you’re cheating on someone or you’re being cheated on, everyone laughs at bad jokes and eats over-sweet boiled vegetables.” – Izaya Orihara

“I don’t believe in god. There’s no proof he exists. In a world where there isn’t even proof of the future, the past exists. Even if it’s tainted with misunderstandings and delusions, if the people themselves believe in it, the past is the truth to them. And, if you base your actions or your life around it, in a way, it’s a type of god itself.” – Izaya Orihara

“A name has nothing to do with loving someone.” – Seiji Yagiri
“What you see isn’t necessarily reality. Everyone has secrets, things they feel that they can’t tell anyone. There’s no such thing as a normal person.” – Celty Sturluson
“The world isn’t as cruel as you take it to be.” – Celty Sturluson

“If you make fiction just as valuable as reality, then any reality you don’t need can be a delusion.” – Erika Karisawa
“Reality is such a pain. And for those of us who get fed up with that kind of reality, we simply choose to make a new one. We create little walls, and separate the trash from the stuff we like, and when that’s all done we keep the things we care about and kick the rest to the curb. You’d be amazed how well it works! A whole world made out of just moe, tsundere, and BL, it’s the best discovery ever! If you ask me, that really is the best way to separate reality, from fiction.” – Erika Karisawa“A poor choice seals our fate.” – Kurama
“It most certainly isn’t pleasant being called a “traitor” by creatures you’ve never met.” – Kurama
“Does he really believe we would turn around after all that we’ve been through?” – Kurama
“You were wrong on two counts. Even the hardest substance can be broken, when crashed into itself. And the ability to feel pain is not a weakness. It’s a strength. Pain tells a creature its vulnerabilities, and not you expose them to attack. Your robot is dead. And so, I’m afraid, are you.” – Kurama
“I’ll help you… But not by death, this world has enough of that. You can keep your life as long as you change the way you live it. It’s never too late, believe me.” – Kurama

“Detective, don’t waste your time trying to change their minds. Fight by their meaningless rules and you’ll be pulled down with them. There’s only one real law of the dark tournament: the strongest man prevails. I’ve retrieved enough energy to rip my way out, let’s show this entire stadium a new definition for victory!” – Hiei
“Being lucky seems to be your greatest tactic.” – Hiei
“My arm did not obey a certain command I gave it, so I decided it needed to be punished.” – Hiei
“Obviously you are underestimating Kurama. Do you know why I chose him to be my partner? To avoid fighting him myself. Watch, he’s more cut-throat then I am when it comes to battle, and unbelievably precise.” – Hiei
“What repulsive creature makes my eardrums bleed?” – Hiei
“Does a death wish cause you to talk to me that way?” – Hiei
“Even as a child, I found tremendous pleasure in spilling my enemy’s blood. Their screams of agony were my music.” – Hiei
“Do I have to kill you to stop you from being foolish?” – Hiei
“You do them one favor and they think you’re their best friend. This is why I could care less if their entire species was swallowed up.” – Hiei
“Kurama, there is no person who does not carry scars upon their heart, and if there were such a man, they would be a shallow soul.” – Hiei
“This is pure offense. They gave up fighting with their brains a long time ago.” – Hiei
“Don’t worry fool, we’ve entered into an alliance and I’m not the type to break it. Of course, after we win the tournament I can’t guarantee anything.” – Hiei

“It’s simple. Even the strongest tree will die if left in the dark. I find that to be the best way to describe us. A giant oak, crashing through a dark soil, bringing order to an otherwise chaotic land. The Shinobi have done their job for centuries, and done it well. But in recent years, we have caught glimpses of the outside world, and asked: “Why not us? Have we not earned the privilege others take for free?”.” – Toya
“I’m not a fighter of good. I just hate people who are bad.” – Genkai
“Yusuke… Dammit Yusuke, listen to me! Everyone has to fight with time to find their place before their inevitable death. Toguro… he ran away from that fight. Don’t you ever do the same. No human is ever a one man show. Every decision that you make will affect the countless people who care about you. Do you understand? You can’t be a cocky kid anymore.” – Genkai
“This is the world you’ve stuck yourself into, if you aren’t strong enough to lead, then you lose the privilege of getting what you want.” – Genkai
“Oh, silly me. I must have forgotten to turn on my hearing aid. When you’re a washed up old hag like me, the memory is the first to go.” – Genkai

“Maybe there’ve been times when I’ve been pissed and hated things, but it wasn’t from this work. My dad’s a no-show, my mom’s lush and school sucks, but this job is the one damn thing I’m good at. If all the crap in my life hasn’t screwed up yet, then neither will this and neither will you.” – Yusuke Urameshi

“It’s like an automated vending machine for canned juice. You’ll get what you want so long as you have the money, but… You get nothing in return without it. You can’t buy your way into the hearts of others.” – Ai Haibara
“In this world, who knows who might kill who.” – Shinichi Kudo
“Sorry, a trick is nothing but a puzzle mankind came up with. If you use your head, you can uncover the logical answer. It’s disappointing. No matter the explanation I think of, I cannot understand why one person would kill another. Even if I can see why, I can’t understand why.” – Shinichi Kudo

“When we started the light music club we said that our slogan was going to be “Budokan or bust!” We worked after school jobs together so I could buy Geeta. We had tea in the club room together and talked about everything. We had training camps at Mugi-chan’s summer homes and looked for a new student who would join the club. I can’t really say we devoted our selves wholeheartedly to practicing, but right now, for us standing here on this stage this auditorium is our Budokan, and we’ll sing our hearts out to the very end!” – Yui Hirasawa
“Where on earth would you find such a hot fifty year old?” – Sawako Yamanaka

“It’s fine if he holds bad judgement without trying to get to know me. The real point is letting just the ones who want to understand me know my real self.” – Kyoya Ootorri

“I thought that I was, to a certain degree, an intelligent person. When I realized I was an idiot, I was really shocked!” – Suoh Tamaki
“The spring of my heart surges upon the sight of your fresh smile, my love.” – Suoh Tamaki
“Do you think you could tell me what true strength is? I may be out of line, but hiding your true self and putting on airs doesn’t seem any different than running away to me. I would think that embracing the things you truly like and being able to enjoy them is worth more than anything. To just be yourself… I believe that’s what true strength really is.” – Suoh Tamaki
“So don’t be afraid to open your hearts to others. It’s pointless to keep testing people. All you’re doing is hurting yourselves.” – Suoh Tamaki
“You’re a hero to other poor people, Fujioka. You’ve shown the world that even a poor person can excel at an elite private academy. It must be hard for you to constantly be looked down upon by others… Spurned, neglected, but that doesn’t matter now. Long live the poor! We welcome you, poor man, to our world… of beauty!” – Suoh Tamaki
“Forgive my rudeness, but to hide your true self and make a vain display… I think that’s just running away from reality. To know what you are really like, and acknowledge it… A positive thinking of enjoying yourself… isn’t that what true strength is?” Suoh Tamaki
“A little water never hurt anyone. Besides, people are always telling me that I’m dripping with good looks.” – Suoh Tamaki

“Well, I don’t see what’s so funny. I’m honest, I speak my mind, and I don’t hold back. It’s sneaky people like Kaoru who are the troublemakers.” – Hikaru Hitachiin

“A person who can’t care about himself can’t protect anyone, I think.” – Mitsukuni Haninozuka
“We’ve had enough of this! You’re both to blame for this fight! Hika-chan and Kao-chan, I want you to make up and go halfsies on this cake, okay? But, I want to have a piece too, so I guess we’re gonna have to go thirdsies. We’re not going to be able to split the strawberry on top though. What should we do? Maybe I should just take it. After all, strawberries are my favorite. Oh, I forgot to ask, Hika-chan, Kao-chan, do you like strawberries?” – Mitsukuni Haninozuka
“I think guys who can’t make up their minds..,are scum.” – Mitsukuni Haninozuka
“I like people who put in effort, even if they’re not good at it.” – Mitsukuni Haninozuka
“Feelings you have for each other will not be known unless you voice them.”  – Kaoru Hitachiin“I want you to be part of that whole.” – Emma
“Even if it’s impossible, I want to escape with everyone. Let’s figure it out. I don’t want all of us to die. But there’s no option to leave them behind. I want Conny to be the last. I don’t want anyone to end up like that ever again. If there isn’t one, then let’s make a place for humans to live outside. Let’s change the world.” – Emma
“You mean, in exchange for spying on us, they won’t get shipped out and can live?” – Emma
“if we escape, that person’s life will not be guaranteed any more. Also, I want to believe, after all. The incident with Gilda made me realize that. Ray told me to suspect everyone, but even if there’s a traitor who is a demon’s agent, no one within our siblings is a bad person. We’re family that grew up together. Even if that person gets in the way, betrays us, or says I’m naïve, I want to believe in that person!” – Emma
“Is this place a farm? Are we all… food? No, it can’t be. Everyone found foster homes. And Mom… It was the usual, kin Mom, right? We were mistaken. That girl wasn’t Conny, right?” – Emma
“What happened to that child… or rather, children? You didn’t cause them to be shipped out early, did you? You didn’t sacrifice someone for our sake, did you? Actually, never mind. Thank you. Thanks to that, we can all escape together now. But… Don’t do something like that ever again. You’re not alone anymore.” – Emma
“Don. Gilda. There’s no more lying, so let me ask again. If we mess up, we die. The outside world is, at worst, a world filled with demons. Even so, will you run away with us?” – Emma
“You’re coming with us. You have to be with us, or else!” – Emma
“I’m going to return to Grace Field within the next two years. We’re going to save the rest of our family that we left behind, the ones that were 4 and younger, and we’ll lead them and all those bred for food over to the human world. Come with us, mister, to the human world. Let’s go see the world our friends wanted to see!” – Emma
“Hey, Emma. Did you really give up? You haven’t actually given up, have you? Emma.” – Ray
” I swear. I’ll never do it again. Let’s all escape from here together.” – Ray
“Hey, Mom. Why did you give birth to me?” – Ray
“Dang. And I thought I was doing so well.” – Ray
“Isn’t this the greatest? The perfect corer with the set shipment date will burn up. She won’t be able to abandon me. I’ve been waiting for this day. I decided this a long time ago. Many, many years ago. It’s a childish retaliation. You know what, Emma? I’ve never really been interested in studying or reading. But I endured it, and I worked hard to improve my value to the highest it could be. Twelve years. I’m a feast that they’ve been waiting for. I’m going to take that away from them tonight. Right before the harvest, they’ve been looking forward to. Don’t think you can eat me. Don’t think you can serve me. Food? Merchandise? I don’t give a crap! I’m a human being! Serves them right!” – Ray
“You… So you were planning to return from the start, huh? You said so yourself, right? That we’ll stay alive together! But you were already planning to.” – Ray
“You brats better escape. You’re good at playing tag, right? Run… And run… And survive. Then destroy this damned world we live in!” – Sister Krone
“Norman and Ray, right? Yes. I heard you get perfect scores on the tests. That’s amazing. It’s nice to meet you. I hope we can get along.” – Sister Krone
“Running while carrying two kids. You must be tired, Emma. You won’t be able to move unless you rest. Did you know? Norman’s weakness is physical strength. I heard he was feeble when he was younger. Ray’s weakness is that he’s a little quick to give up. He makes a decision fast but abandons them just as quickly. And you, Emma! Your weakness is your naiveté. Like how naive you are by carrying others when you’re being chased. Just give up and come on out. I won’t do you wrong. Listen, Emma. If you saw the harvest that day… Then I’m on your side.” – Sister Krone
“So you already knew the location of the tracking devices and how to break them? I’m impressed. I see. I understand a lot now. It’s not just words that provide information. Humans give away a lot of information just by standing there. Attitude. Gaze. Blinking. Sweat. Gestures. Pupils. Pulse. All of these are hints to find out what you’re really thinking. And yet for you two, even though I said the tracking device was in your ear, you didn’t touch them to check. The arrangements to get them out were made, but you didn’t look happy at all. So, why did you ask about the tracking devices when it wasn’t necessary? Is there something you want to hide from me? Are you keeping a secret?” – Sister Krone
“Ray. How do you know that song?” – Isabella
“Yes. I am happy. Because I was able to meet someone like you.” – Isabella
“I lost. Go on. Please be careful. And I pray that you will find light.” – Isabella
“This is troublesome, Sister Krone, that you get in Isabella’s way. They are special. Isabella and her plant. Isabella is a necessary pawn for me. You are insufficient to take her place. It will become troublesome for me. May we offer the best plate at the Tifari. May the farm have maximum profits.” – Grandmother
“Because if they were, there’s no way this would be here. It would have been delivered to Conny. It’s not just Little Bunny. They were all snatched away from them by Mom when they left, and they were all taken away by bad people.” – Gilda
“So it was true, what they said. Mom was lying. No one was sent to foster families.” – Gilda
“The escape will succeed.” – Norman
“Would you leave that person behind? Or take them with us?” – Norman
“The plan isn’t over yet. Your leg will heal.” – Norman
“Hey… Are you happy, Mom?” – Norman
“No matter who it is, I won’t let you escape.” That’s probably what Mom wants to say.” – Norman
“You already know by now, right? I set a trap for three people. To Don, I said the rope was under my bed. To Gilda, I said the second floor bathroom’s ceiling. That’s what I told you, Ray. But actually, I told Don it was in the dining hall, and told Gilda it was in the library. Then the rope that was under my bed disappeared. Then what about the other two locations? Should we go check them now?” – Norman“We’re searching for a reason of existence. With our own strength, because maybe the truth is that there’s no reason for life from the very beginning. Everyone hopes and tries so hard to find a reason of existence. The reason of birth, of staying with someone, of existence, believing we have to find them all with our own hands. Like finding a place for ourselves in dreams, in jobs, in people. The reasons we conclude may be indefinite and fragile. We may lose it too, but even so, we want a reason. As long as I’m alive, I want it too. If possible, I want to find a reason of existence within a person, within someone.” – Tohru Honda
“The scariest and the most painful thing is to be hated by someone you truly love.” – Tohru Honda
“It’s not always easy to see the good in people. In some people, you might even doubt that it’s there at all. But if you can somehow, find a way to believe…sometimes that’s all it takes to help someone, to give them the strength to find the good in themselves.” – Tohru Honda
“My mom told me, it’s better to trust people than to doubt them. She said that people aren’t born with kind hearts. When we’re born, all we have are desires for food and material things. Selfish instincts, I guess. But she said that kindness is something that grows inside of each person’s body, but it’s up to us to nurture that kindness in our hearts. That’s why kindness is different for every person.” – Tohru Honda
“A conscience grows, just like the body. It’s bred within your heart. That’s why the shape of people’s kindness is so different.” – Tohru Honda
“Mom taught me that people’s differences are something to celebrate. When I thought of all the different shapes of human kindness — imagining them as round or square…I got really excited. Your kindness is like a candle Sohma-kun. I can feel it light up, and I just want to smile. It’s that kind of kindness.” – Tohru Honda
“Sometimes living can be hard! But it’s only because we’re alive that we can make each other laugh, cry, and be happy!” – Tohru Honda
“As long as you live things will keep happening! As long as you’re alive wishes will keep being made!” – Tohru Honda
“As they played the game…I waited for someone to call “onigiri”. But no one called. I was very little then. I had almost forgotten about that. But they knew…there would never be room for an onigiri…in a fruits basket.” – Tohru Honda
“No one really starts out kind. All we know how to do at first is want. We want food, we want attention… It’s just natural survival instinct, I guess… But kindness is something that we all have to learn as we go. It’s something that grows and develops slowly over time… The same way our bodies do.” – Tohru Honda
“Being away from everyone else may be lonely, but being away from you will be even lonelier.” – Tohru Honda
“I don’t think anyone is born knowing the reason why they’re here. It’s just something you have to find as you go along.” – Tohru Honda
“My happiness comes from the kindness of those around me.” – Tohru Honda
“If you think of someone’s good qualities as the umeboshi in an onigiri, it’s as if their qualities are stuck to their back! People around the world are like onigiri. Everyone has an umeboshi with a different shape and color and flavor. But because it’s stuck on their back, they might not be able to see their umeboshi.” – Tohru Honda
“I’m sure that inside your heart…you’re trying with all your might to find it on your own…the reason you were born. Because…because really…there might not be anyone who was born with a reason. I think that everyone might have to find one on their own. A reason for being born… A reason that it’s okay to be alive… A reason to exist.” – Tohru Honda
“There are things that take a long time to acquire. Friends. Love. Really, nothing has been a waste.” – Megumi Hanajima
“I’m a complete failure. At everything I do, I’m absolutely worthless. I know this, and yet I continue to burden the human race with my presence. Every day I rob the world of valuable air by breathing. I’m a thief, and I hate myself for it. I don’t deserve to exist. But even though I know it’s the right thing to do, I’m such a useless coward. I don’t even have the courage to jump!” – Ritsu Sohma
“For there to be pain, there has to be kindness. For darkness to stand out, there has to be the sun.” – Kyoko Honda
“Ah, I’m sorry, I guess this is farewell. Let Tohru find happiness. Please by many people let her be loved. If you become perplexed or make errors, in the end have the kind of life that you can have pride in living. The kind where you can say, “I persevered”. Repeating delightful things and sad things. And in that way keep getting older. I persevered.” – Kyoko Honda
“If you don’t protect that child, I will never forgive you!” – Kyoko Honda
“Tohru, you must always be yourself and do things at your own pace. Someday… you’ll catch up.” – Kyoko Honda
“They say that we should love ourselves first, before other people learn to love us, but it’s not as easy as it seems. Sometimes, we need someone to accept us and love us first, then we would learn to see ourselves through that person’s eyes and learn to love our-self.” – Yuki Sohma
“A woman who can talk tough while completely naked…amazing.” – Yuki Sohma
“It would be so great if it was possible to go through life without making a single mistake.” – Yuki Sohma
“Don’t you ever talk about Miss Honda that way again, you low life.” – Yuki Sohma
“If I were to live out life without any mistakes that would be great. But… there is no such path. Falling, tripping, losing the way, making mistakes, little by little, walking one step at a time, this is the only way to live out life.” – Yuki Sohma
“I’m not sure why I’ve decided to do this. I’m not any stronger than I was, and nothing else has changed. But all the same, this time I’m not going to run away. It’s okay to feel weak sometimes. It’s okay to be afraid. The important thing is that we face our fears. That’s… that’s what makes us strong.” – Yuki Sohma
“Just as no matter how hard you try to keep it away, despair will attack you again and again. In the same manner, hope will return to you. Again and again.” – Kazuma Sohma
“You’re afraid to face what you know you must. So instead… you run away. The air that you said was smothering you… you know that it can also heal you. But you refuse to let it. You refuse to let anyone see you for your true self. You’re too afraid of what you might lose. You’re running away because you’re afraid to admit your feelings even to yourself.” – Kazuma Sohma

“When you get anxious about the future, it is better not to think about it. The more you think about it the more anxious you’ll get. Of course it’s important to think about what lies ahead, too, but if you only look at what’s down the road, you’ll get tangled by the “laundry” by your feet and fall, won’t you? You see, it’s also important to think about what you can do now. What you can do today, and if you keep washing things one at a time, you’ll be done before you know it.” – Shigure Sohma
“People aren’t born social. Sure it comes easier to some people… but most people, like you, need to work at it. Some more than others. You’re just inexperienced. For example, as a martial artist, you have the strength to break the table with your fist. But you also have the self-control to stop your fist right before it hits the table. You weren’t born with that control, were you? You had to refine it. It’s the same as interacting with people. But training for that isn’t in the mountains – it has to be in town where people live. Mingling with people, hurting them, getting hurt by them. That’s how you learn about people and about yourself.” – Shigure Sohma
“With so much at stake… are you willing to take the one in 10,000 chance?” – Shigure Sohma

“However, I can’t be happy. I feel I can’t have that experience, I can’t assume I will have that experience. I’m free, but feeling lonely and disheartened. I hope there’s happiness out there. Besides, the future is approaching and waiting for me. In the future, I will be a part of the world. I will finally live my life.” – Momiji Sohma
“Pain, suffering. It’s pointless to just think about those things. The traveler didn’t. That may be stupid to some people but that’s not stupid to me. Yuki… Kyo… when you close your eyes, what do you think?” – Momiji Sohma

“Strangely enough, when you get older, the things you didn’t understand when you were a child… start to make sense. “When this happened, I should have done that.” “When that happened, I should have said this.” Those types of things. You start to understand rather than regret. It may be closer to repentance. So it may be that I do want to repent and erase the ignorant self from my childhood. Maybe that’s what they mean when they say adults are selfish.” – Ayame Sohma
“It’s just that I’m fighting the pain of lost love. I guess it’s what you’d call a rude awakening… or, maybe… the weight of responsibility? But I’m fine. I’m fine. Caring for someone isn’t based on logic. You can’t really rationalize emotions. Once I think “I like him”… it’s all over.” – Kagura Sohma
“Is it okay for me to have my own life now, father, now that I’m not “special” anymore?” – Kagura Sohma

“Even if Hell is where we’re headed. You people might not have found it, but we’re going to. We will find Paradise.” – Tsume
“When are we born? When do we die? Why are we born? Why do we die? The world has been destroyed and we’ve fallen countless times, always resurrecting from the ashes as Paradise. It has happened before, and it will happen again. An endless cycle of life and death. The world is a Paradise that was opened by someone, but this era too is almost at an end. We have acquired the means to exceed our natural span of life, never suspecting that the world itself was finalized in its existence. This knowledge has left me in despair, my fate has fallen and scattered like the petals of a dying flower, like the blast from a sand storm it has been worn down and weathered away. As if to be purified, the world will be encased in ice so that it can return to the beginning once more.” – Spirit Owl
“They say there’s no such place… as Paradise. Even if you search to the ends of the Earth, there’s nothing there. No matter how far you walk, it’s always the same road. It just goes on and on.

“Can you do me a favor? Could you kill me with your fangs? Can you still not forgive me? Am I still a traitor?” – Hige
“Let’s meet up again in Paradise.” – Hige
“You gotta do what you can to survive. Keep looking like that, and you’ll be back here in no time at all. It draws too much attention.” – Hige
“No reason. It smelled like something interesting was going to happen, and I just followed my nose, you know? Besides, I’ve got nowhere else to go.” – Hige

“That hot dog must’ve fried your brain!” – Hige
“We would not have met, and the flowers will protect you. Kiba, because you protected this one, the flowers will return and bloom once more. So when the world is reborn, and Paradise opens, we will meet again. This one will be waiting for you. Find this one. And this time, the Paradise you hoped for will be.” – Cheza

“The world where you will go hand in hand with the flower maiden has neither perfect happiness nor joy nor life. This is because it also does not contain perfect sadness nor misery nor death.

I have yet to comprehend it.” – Manabu Horikita

If you want to earn something, you need to reach out for it. Pro-athletes give up their teenage years to train. Business owners put up collateral to borrow money. That’s how it always works. To make your ambitions come true, you have to take risks. The larger the ambition the greater the risk. That might involve time or enough work to affect your lifespan… So make your choice.

“No matter what you’re doing, the most essential thing is to not give up. Fail as many times as it takes. Keep trying persistently until you can call yourself ‘average’.

Deciding on what’s wrong and what’s right is entirely circumstantial for those bast***. Basically they’re just like animals, only a little bit smarter.

Such self absorbed idiots aren’t worth protecting if you ask me.” – Saber Of Red

“A day when everything is perfect, when everything will turn into memories, will eventually come. But I’ll probably remember over and over again you were there and everyone else was there. The day we all searched for just one thing.” – Yuuta Takemoto
“To wish for your own happiness is sometimes coupled with another’s unhappiness. Since I couldn’t pray for my own happiness, I prayed to the moon in the night sky for the happiness of the one whose warm hand I held.” – Yuuta Takemoto
“Mayama, if you can’t be with her on every festival, then you have no right to say anything.” – Takumi Nomiya
“Why are you blocking us when you have someone else that you like? We can easily see her feelings towards you so there’s no way you haven’t realized what’s there.

“A guy who likes someone else shouldn’t be taking care of the girl he just dumped.” – Takumi Nomiya

“It’s just… a love that’s continued for many years without straying is something that, to anyone who sees it, is beautiful and impossible to fault. But… Though it may be short, and it may be something that’s become crooked and bent partway through, if they’re serious about the way they feel… then I don’t think that’s something that isn’t beautiful.” – Maiko Shu

“I’ll tell you a way that I heard to figure out if you like someone or not. Imagine, when you find a rainbow, when you found a shooting star, when you found a cafe you like, when your change is 777 yen or something. If it’s Raku, it’s fine to imagine the first time a leaf stood up in your tea. When you found a beautiful sunset, or if you found your taste in music, or if you win a pretty good prize in the lottery, those small things in everyday life. When you encounter those small happiness or luck, who is the very first person you want to tell that to? Whose face came into your mind?” – Maiko Shu
“Seeing them as the same is wrong. It’s a touchy subject, but the weight of something you bear with your own power and with someone else’s are different.” – Maiko Shu

Is that all you’ve got for Raku!? At least for the last time, you need to be a little more truthful to yourself!! If you really liked him, then you can’t just pretend like nothing ever happened!” – Marika Tachibana
“Holding in your own feelings like that… ye think that no one’s gonna get hurt since you’re not letting it show to anyone? That’s just the same as going round hurting everyone anyway!” – Marika Tachibana

“Why did you run away, Chitoge-chan? No… I don’t want this… I won’t be happy with you just giving up… To end up liking the same person. It’s painful, for sure but Chitoge-chan, you like him enough to not be able to face him again after that, don’t you? Regardless of who ends up with him, I want to be satisfied when it happens. I thought for sure that you think the same way. Is there a reason why that can’t happen? Tell me Chitoge-chan.” – Kosaki Onodera

“A terrible premonition can bring about a terrible reality.” – Shiki Ryougi
“A rose will be born a rose. Different soil and water wouldn’t change it into a different flower.” – Touko Aozaki

“There are three conditions to terrify someone: One, the monster can’t speak. Two, the monster has to be unidentifiable. Three, it’s meaningless if the monster can die.” – Touko Aozaki
“What does a view from a high place remind you of? The impulse you feel when you look down at the world you live in. A violent cognition that attacks you even if you refuse it. An emotion created by an overlooking view – That’s “far”. The scenery you see from a high place is magnificent. Even an ordinary landscape looks beautiful. But a vision that’s too large creates a boundary between you and the world. It’s more correct for you to recognize the large world you see as the world you live in, rather than as the small space around you. But you can’t feel that you’re living in this big world no matter how hard you try. Your reasoning represented by your knowledge, and you experience represented by your realization, will crash against each other. And eventually you will lose yourself and confusion will begin.” – Touko Aozaki
“People do not cease to exist immediately after dying, as long as there are people who remember them.” – Touko Aozaki
“A writer once said that “a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when he has nothing left to add, but when he has nothing left to take away”.” – Touko Aozaki
“There are two ways to escape: escape without a purpose, and escape with a purpose. I call the former “floating”, and the latter “flight”. You are the only one that decides which of the two your view of the world from on high was. But you don’t choose these paths because of the weight on your soul. We don’t choose the path we take because of the sins we carry. But we carry our sins on the path we choose.” – Touko Aozaki

“The flash of light I felt when I was stabbed in the heart. The overwhelming torrent of death and the beat of life. I always thought I had nothing, but there is still that simple thing left in me. This fear that sends a chill down my spine. I have to feel the most death I can to feel the happiness of life. For everything in my life I have ignored until now. But it probably would be impossible to die like I did that night. I probably cannot hope for such a striking end. That death pierced me like lightning, like a needle, like a sword. That’s why I will try to come as close to that as possible. I don’t have any idea right now but I still have a few days to think about it. And I’ve already decided on the method. I don’t think I even need to say this, but I think my end should be a long fall from a place overlooking the world.” – Kirie Fujou
“It wasn’t the pain that hurt me. Rather, it was the feeling of me being ripped apart, and the sound of the knife plunging deep, deep into my heart. That incomparably bittersweet fear. My body shook and trembled at the thought of it. My silent weeping contained my uneasiness, my loneliness, my will to live. My tears aren’t from the pain either, or from the fear of the encounter. It was for the brush of death that I had never before experienced, but had now fallen in love with, even though I pray every night for the strength to live.” – Kirie Fujou“Do you want to have your meal?

“Please stop talking…you’re gonna make it harder.” – Keita Suminoe
“I just want to bolster your confidence in being a woman by doing dirty things.” – Keita Suminoe
“There’s nothing wrong with it right? We can sleep together.” – Keita Suminoe

So, if we consider every one of them as hate, we’ll be right most of the time. I don’t have time to pick out the truth anyway.” – Nora Floriann
“Human hearts are complicated mysteries.” – Haqua du Lot Herminium

“in the first place, the logic that says “those who play games are kids” is itself an allusion. therefore one might say that shoehorning reality onto your stubborn dualism is already criticism of the self. In short, humans can only help recognize reality through the filter called “me” and so they are unable to escape the constraints of their uncanny existence.” – Katsuragi Keima

“It’s our job as normal people to ensure the potential of those misunderstood ones are realized.” – Sora
“Accept that because we were born with nothing, we can become anything!” – Sora
“Because of our weakness, we trained our eyes, ears and the ability to think. Learning how to survive, that’s our trait as humans! The human species can’t use magic and can’t even perceive it – but because we are weak, we have the wisdom to run away from magic and the intelligence to see through it. We don’t have any extraordinary senses. But because we are weak, by learning and gaining experience, we gained the wisdom to achieve the unachievable.” – Sora
“There’s no more trusted observer than someone who suspects you.” – Sora
“In fairy tales, when the protagonists end up in a different world, they do their best to get back home, right? But who would want to go back to a world like that?” – Sora

“Whats the probability of drawing the ace of spades from a deck with no jokers? Normaly it would be 1/50. But what if its a brand new deck? The position of cards in a new deck are typically identical, so that means if you take out the jokers and draw the card at the very bottom, it’s the ace of spades almost 100% of the time. Oh that’s right! I didn’t say a word about it being a new deck. Rather, you didn’t ask. Being in the “know” gives you the power to turn the probability of winning from 1.92% to 100%. The more knowledge of a party will be the inevitable victor.” – Sora

All our needs, desires, and instincts seek cuteness, and it is for cuteness that we will give everything we have! That’s just the way men are!” – Sora

“Gaining” and “losing” things are an unavoidable part of life for everyone. You feel joy, you feel disappointment, and it repeats. And that’s how you learn to handle your feelings.

Somewhere along the line, the people who have been fighting alongside me have disappeared, first one and then another.

“When you got a problem you can’t fix yourself, like today, there’s a good chance that if you work together with someone else, you can overcome it. If someone helps you like that, the next time they’re having trouble, you should them. That’s how the world works. You know… that’s pretty important. Listen. If things seem hopeless when you’re alone, then rely on someone. Otherwise, to be honest, no one will rely on you.” – Takashi Hayashida

“You refuse to make an effort with anything because you’re scared of learning your own capacity and being disappointed by it. But… it’s okay to be disappointed.

Once you do that, you’ll at least be able to get past your incredible anxiety. I can guarantee at least that.” – Kokubu Sensei“I’m rather proud of my ability to tell lies.

“I guess not knowing someone doesn’t mean you don’t understand them.” – Kyoko Kirigiri

“Even if I could redo the past, I must not take back what has already happened, because if I do that, everything would be a lie: those tears, that pain, those memories, that cold reality that hurts my heart, all of it. There were people who died in pain. There were people who risked their lives to save others. There were people who mourned for the deaths. But then, if everything were taken back and it did not happen, where would all of those go? The dead people would not come back. Reality cannot be overturned.” – Shirou Emiya
“Blue sky is in the distance. It feels so close. Yet, I cannot grab it even if I reach out with my hands. I looked up at the stars before. The stars that I cannot reach and the wishes that will not be granted. There is nothing we have been able to leave behind for each other. Therefore, traces and memories will disappear someday. But still… Even if it will not reach her, there should be something that will remain in our hearts. There is nothing that remains in our hands, but we lived the same time and looked up at the same things.

“That’s right. I don’t create swords. I create a world that contains infinite swords. This is the only magic allowed for me. There’s no need to be surprised. These are all imitations. As you say, these are all trifling swords. But there is no rule that says an imitation cannot defeat the original. If you say you are the original, I will surpass every one of your weapons and destroy your existence.” – Shirou Emiya

“I can’t lose against myself. There’s no element that would make me lose if our powers are equal. To admit defeat against such an enemy is to declare that I’m wrong.” – Shirou Emiya
“The things we can’t obtain are the most beautiful ones.” – Gilgamesh
“”Hero of Justice? A world where no one is hurt?” Don’t be absurd. “Humanity” is the name for an animal that cannot find joy in life without sacrifice. The pretty lie that is “equality” is nonsense spouted by weaklings who cannot look upon the darkness. Nothing but an excuse to cover up life’s ugliness.” – Gilgamesh
“If a couple curses stopped me, what kind of hero would I be?!” – Gilgamesh
“If you don’t like pain, stand still. I’ll finish you off nice and quickly!” – Rin Tohsaka

“A certain scripture mentions that humans are superior to angels. Why? Because there are people who know of evil, but do not become evil.

“If there is a pure wish in this world, it must be the desire to be born.” – Kirei Kotomine
“There are worthless things, but there are no meaningless things.” – Kirei Kotomine

“Suppose that you were sitting down at a table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’.” – Funny Valentine
“Right about now, you’re probably wondering who I am. Allow me to elucidate ya! The name is Robert E. O. Speedwagon! I had a hunch Jonathan’s run of trouble might not be done, so I followed him back home. I like you, Jonathan, so I’m gonna offer up this little tidbit pro bono: living in the gutter, you learn to spot lowlifes pretty quick if you want to see tomorrow. I’ve trained my nose to sort out the bad ones from the good just from a sniff. This fellow reeks of brimstone and blood worse than anyone I’ve ever laid eyes on!” – Speedwagon

Then I can always run and always fly.” – Arata Kohata

“The only atonement you will ever realize will be that of you’re own death. You will be justly and severely punished, before you ever find the peace you seek Kenshin. That is the meaning of ‘Jinchū’. Those who live must act in the place of those who have died.” – Enishi Yukishiro
“If you were to examine a man’s entire life, you would see that it is full of contradictions.” – Nenji Kashiwazaki
“Who falls for who depends completely on the person. If there are a hundred people, there are a hundred ways to love… There never is one absolute form of love.” – Nenji Kashiwazaki
“You’ll only realize that you truly love someone if they already caused you enormous pain. Your enemies can never hurt you the way your loved ones can. It’s the people close to your heart that can give you the most piercing wound. Love is a double-edged sword, it can heal the wound faster or it can sink the blade even deeper.” – Kenshin Himura
“We once fought together for an ideal with our swords. It wasn’t for power or for glory, but to create a peaceful world where people could live without fear. And if you should forget about that, then what did we fight the revolution for?” – Kenshin Himura
“We shouldn’t blame ourselves for bad things that happened to us. Sometimes, no matter what we do, we are victims of the circumstances.” – Kenshin Himura
“When one person kills, resentment is born. That resentment makes a person kill again. To sever that vicious cycle–that is the purpose of this sword that cannot kill.” – Kenshin Himura
“To tell you the truth, I much prefer Miss Kaoru’s sweet and innocent talk over the truth, indeed I do!” – Kenshin Himura
“I want you to understand something. If you should lose, not only does your future end, but also the future of the one you are trying to protect. Defeat isn’t an option for the sword that protects others. You should keep that thought engraved in your heart.” – Kenshin Himura
“The dead don’t desire revenge, but the happiness of the living.” – Kenshin Himura
“The moment you find the courage to give up your life for someone, would be the moment you understand love.” – Kenshin Himura
“Are you saddened by your lack of power, young one?” – Kenshin Himura
“Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again, but what you throw away you’ll never get it back.” – Kenshin Himura
“You can die anytime, but living takes true courage.” – Kenshin Himiura
“New eras don’t come about because of swords, they’re created by the people who wield them.” – Kenshin Himura
“The scar of my past will determine my future!” – Kenshin Himura
“Helping other people is the best way to make up for your mistakes.” – Kenshin Himura
“Accepting one’s own strength, and the strength of others, is an important quality of a swordsman.” – Kenshin Himura
“When I was at the brink of life and death, I used all of my will to survive. I drew upon a different power than that of self-sacrifice and mastered an ultimate technique. The will to live is stronger than anything else. That was the ray of light that my master risked his life to show me. As Hitokiri Battousai, I have committed so many crimes that I cannot possibly repent for them. That is why I had secretly believed that it didn’t matter when I died or was killed. However, now… even if I am formally punished or restrained. I will never lose the will to live.” – Kenshin Himura
“If fighting could provide us with the truth, nobody would make any mistakes in their lives. A person’s life is not that easy. The truth you must learn from yourself, from how you live your life.” – Kenshin Himura
“What is truly good about a person can’t be expressed in words, that it can not. What matters is the feeling of trust one gets after spending time with him.” – Kenshin Himura
“Perhaps the distant part of the sky always seems clearest, so that we will always strive to reach it.” – Kenshin Himura
“You believe that the strong exist to cull the weak. To use them as food. But you are mistaken… The strong exist, not to feed off of the weak, but to protect them!” – Kenshin Himura
“Cherry blossoms in Spring. Stars cover the sky on Summer. Full moon shines on Autumn and in Winter, the snow covers the ground. All these things make sake taste good. If it tastes bad, it’s because there is something wrong in you.” – Seijuro Hiko
“The moon pierced down on the diseased world. There is no cure for the disease. An entire race falls mindlessly into destruction. Not even a man of colossal power may be able to prevent the inevitable. Death no longer terrifies men. The smell of blood is as common as the smell of white plums, so he creates slavery and savagery which surpasses the horrors of dying. These can only be fought with more bloodshed and the cycle never ends. My sword is guided by the reasoning of Hiten Mitsurugi, but when all is said, a sword is a tool for destruction not salvation. The only way I can retain my humanity is to bury its victims.” – Seijuro Hiko
“Murder is the only art a swordsman may practice. No ornamental words can change that. You want to protect people with murder? You’ll slaughter legions so that a few may live. Many years, long before you were born, my sword was tearing asunder the lives of men. Yes, all of those men were evil, but they were human beings first and foremost, Kenshin. The world you ardently desire to enter will not know what to do with you. It will deceive you into believing that you are saving lives even as you destroy them. You will accept these lies all the while, your hands will be stained with the worst of offenses.” – Seijuro Hiko
“This era is not so simple that you can put everything on your shoulders and be the only sacrifice. And, at the same time, one person’s happiness isn’t that simple, either. If you should fall as a sacrifice, one girl who came to Kyoto with the one wish to see you will definitely face misfortune. Remember that. No matter how strong you get, you are just a human being. There is no need for you to either become Buddha, or a murderer.” – Seijuro Hiko
“Once you have a power, sometimes you are put into a situation which make you carry extra burdens, and live all your life with pain.” – Seijuro Hiko
“No matter how strong one may be, no one can stop the flow of time.” – Seijuro Hiko
“No matter how much you hurt inside, the dead can never return.” – Seijuro Hiko
“It is foolish to listen to one who will not listen to you. Do as you wish.” – Seijuro Hiko
“The world is not so simple. You can’t save people with kindness only.” – Anji Yukyuzan
“Oh well, I guess all those who are in love do crazy things.” – Sanosuke Sagara
“Hey, I’ll have you know that I almost really did kick the bucket during that training, so don’t you dare sum it all up in one word, even if it is a nice one like “potential”.” – Sanosuke Sagara
“You can train a dog with food. You can buy a person with money. But there isn’t a man alive able to influence the wolves of Mibu! Some things will never change. A wolf will always be a wolf.” – Hajime Saito
“I would think that he’s already seen through your heart, and is simply playing the fool to use you. He yanks on the strings of your cheap pride and you dance like a little marionette.” – Hajime Saito
“Let’s just say… what’s mine is mine, and what’s yours… is also mine.” – Hajime Saito
“A man that can’t hold on to his beliefs can only be pathetic, dead or alive.” – Hajime Saito

“Do you like spirits, mommy? Even fuzzy ones?” – Mei Kusakabe
“Everybody, try laughing. Then whatever scares you will go away!” – Tatsuo Kusakabe
“Trees and people used to be good friends. I saw that tree and decided to buy the house. Hope Mom likes it too.” – Tatsuo Kusakabe
“I also believe that you met the King of the Forest, Mei, and meeting him is a sign of good luck. But there’s no guarantee that you’ll see him all the time.” – Tatsuo Kusakabe
“That’s wonderful. Good for you! I’ve always wanted to have a haunted house. It’s been my lifelong dream!” – Tatsuo Kusakabe
“Well, ghosts are a lot harder to see. But when you suddenly move from a lighted room to a dark one, you can’t see for a second, and that’s when the dust bunnies come out.” – Tatsuo Kusakabe
“Totoro, I beg you, please protect Mei. She’ll be lost, and probably scared. Please believe me, I’ll be good for the rest of my life if I can just see her again.” – Satsuki Kusakabe
“I hate boys! But I love Nanny’s food better than anything else in the whole wide world.” – Satsuki Kusakabe
“We thought you might not be too happy about the house being filled with spooks.” – Satsuki Kusakabe
“It isn’t the end of the world. Your old Nanny’s here to help. Let’s see that beautiful smile.” – Kanta’s Grandma
“If we all keep smiling, the sprites may gradually go away and leave this place alone. Yes, I’m sure that somewhere up in that ceiling, they’re busily discussing plans for leaving the house.” – Kanta’s Grandma
“Well, I’m not sure, but I could’ve sworn that I saw both of the girls up in the treetop, laughing.” – Yasuko Kusakabe
“You’d better be careful after I get home, because I intend to spoil them rotten for a while.” – Yasuko Kusakabe“If you misuse a power that’s all too great, you will only destroy yourself.” – Reigen Arataka
“Don’t do it Mob. When things go south, it’s ok to run away!” – Reigen Arataka
“If nothing else, they’re of use to me. And it’s not just me. Think of all the clients you helped with those powers. Don’t just focus no the negatives. It’s all about how you use knives, remember? Don’t surpress yourself. You’re the one who holds the power to maximizing your potential. Trust me you’ll be fine.” – Reigen Arataka
“Listen well, we are different than regular people because we are born with special powers. But that shouldn’t give you the illusion that you’re a special being. We are part of humanity. Besides our rare power, we are no different than them. People who run fast, people who can sing well, people who study hard, people who are funny, and people with psychic powers. Are we different from them? Having confidence in your strength, is good thing but do not get carried away. Our powers are a dangerous weapon.” – Reigen Arataka
“I don’t know what you have against him… But he isn’t a man you can just step on… Right, Kageyama? Someone like you… I’m not gonna give him up! We are training buddies! You’ve always been working so hard! How many times did you collapse due to anemia or injuries? Yet you always stood up and kept going. It didn’t matter if you’re not athletic. It’s the process of your growth… You showed us how much you struggled. You gave us courage. And that… isn’t something that someone can crush that easily! Attacking someone weaker than you… That’s why I won’t hand over Kageyama to you!!” – Musashi Goda
“Surprised? Muscles built with psychic power, will never be as good as properly trained muscles! Shigeo was right this whole time!” – Dimple
“It’s no use trying to get rid of me, because we’re brothers.” – Shigeo Kageyama

“Psychic powers aren’t needed to survive in the first place.” – Shigeo Kageyama
“Con artists are really terrible people.” – Shigeo Kageyama

“If I’m going to be shacked by fear and brainwashed, I’d rather try to escape, even if it means I could die.” – Ritsu Kageyama
“I do not accept losing to anyone besides my big brother.” – Ritsu Kageyama
“I couldn’t handle my inferiority complex and my fear towards you, so I was protecting myself by thinking it was admiration.” – Ritsu Kageyama
“I will not judge you people. Because I know now… When people stray from the right path, there usually isn’t an actual reason. It’s like that even now. I’m facing enemies that lost all will to fight, and I’m moving for the sake of violence. There’s no actual reason… This kind of freedom is strong, I’m much freer than all of you… Why? Because I’ve lost my limits. I’ve obtained loss!” – Ritsu Kageyama
“Dimple… you’re really annoying. Say… If I can gain control of this power… can I get rid of you too?” – Ritsu Kageyama
“Because I’m sick of myself. I just wanted to… feel the ‘foolishness’ of myself. And to create a new self. Me, as a fool.” – Ritsu Kageyama
“You cannot solve all problems with your kindness. Sometimes, you need to be strict to others.” – Keiji Mogami“Do you think that someday, the real stars will ever come back?”- Hei
“If you pretend to feel a certain way, the feeling can become genuine all by accident.” – Hei
“Don’t worry. We don’t think of you as being one of us. Miserably cowering in fear like that – we contractors don’t have the same unflattering emotions that you do. Luckily for us.” – Hei
“Contractors are not human. They’re killing machines, dressed in human skin. In order to keep their risks to a minimum, they make sure to kill all witnesses. They’re liars and betrayers.” – Hei
“Spilled water will never return to its container.” – Hei
“We are the chosen beings, you know. Those not under contract fear us. Maybe it’s only natural; beings with new powers have appeared – beings who are more worthy to direct the world from now on.” – Maki
“It’s funny, you know? You keep chasing after stars for a long time and you sort of develop an attachment to them.” – Misaki Kirihara
“Contractors don’t dream. Indeed, maybe that was what I thought. Which is exactly why I believed in you. I thought that you, at least, would understand my dream.” – Nick Hillman
“Forget everything else – that the moon has disappeared, and how all the rockets that rise above the stratosphere become lost. Believe. Believe that the sky is the same that we once looked at.” – Nick Hillman
“Bearing the sins of the children of earth, the moon begins to consume its light.” – Bertha
“You’re looking at the stars? In the middle of the city? Even though all the stars you see in the sky from here these days are fake?” – Shinoda Chiaki
“I couldn’t understand how there could be such a contractor. Just what was he thinking? What principles did he live by? The more I thought about it, the less I understood.” – November 11
“Secondhand smoke kills, you know. It’s far worse than the fumes you inhale directly. Take diethylene, one of those nasty carcinogens your doctor might have warned you about on your last visit. Firsthand smoke has between 5.3 and 43 nanograms of diethylene, whereas, secondhand smoke has 680 and 823 nanograms. Then we’ve got quinoline, another effective one, secondhand smoke has 18,000 nanograms; 11 times more than the amount you’re sucking down firsthand. You can make the choice to blacken your lungs, but don’t expect to enforce that on me.” – November 11
“I don’t have the information that you’re after. If you are under contract then you know: ultimately, what comes first to a contractor isn’t the organisation or ideology. It’s oneself.” – Havoc Carmine
“The biggest difference between humans and contractors is their mental make-up – what you might call rational judgement.” – Alma
“Strange, isn’t it? A contractor using a word like ‘atonement’.” – Alma
“Impossible! Dolls don’t shed tears!” – Huang
“She’s just a doll – a passive spirit medium. And you contractors are nothing more than killing machines.” – Huang
“You go against the syndicate and you’re the one who’ll get killed.” – Huang“Kamina told me before. “He’s the one that always saves me.”, “He’s the one that doesn’t give up, even at the end.” – Yoko Littner

“Well, Well, Well, Well… Listen up, big guys! I’ll only say this once… Undefeatable, untouchable, with no regrets! Never looking back, never wavering! You can’t win against this man’s will! Gurren Brigade’s Kamina-sama will be your opponent! Believe it!” – Kamina
“God gave us eyes at the front of our heads so we can look forward to the future.” – Kamina

“Don’t be distracted by the what-if’s, should-have’s, and if-only’s. The one thing you choose for yourself – that is the truth of your universe.” – Kamina
“When I feel weak, or when I lack self-confidence, I remember Simon’s back as he dug tirelessly. I wanted to become a man who’s back would never break. That’s what I thought.” – Kamina
“We, brawlers, are sustained by willpower even when mocked as reckless and crazy!” – Kamina
“I didn’t have any confidence. I thought I was living the wrong way. Impatiently. Why couldn’t I go where my father could? Truthfully, I wasn’t strong enough.” – Kamina
“If you are doing it, I’m doing it. If I don’t do it, will you? If you don’t do it, I’ll do it. I’m doing it so that you’ll do it too!!” – Kamina
“When you’re scared, that’s all the more reason to move forward!” – Kittan Bachika
“The dreams of those who’ve fallen! The hopes of those who’ll follow! Those two sets of dreams weave together into a double helix! Drilling a path towards tomorrow! And that’s Tengen Toppa! That’s Gurren Lagann!” – Simon

“We weep for the blood of a bird, but not for the blood of a fish. Blessed are those with a voice. If the dolls could speak, no doubt they’d scream, “I didn’t want to become human”.” – Motoko Kusanagi
“What if a cyber brain could possibly generate its own ghost, and create a soul all by itself? And if it did, just what would be the importance of being human then?” – Motoko Kusanagi

“When I float weightless back to the surface, I’m imagining I’m becoming someone else.” – Motoko Kusanagi
“If we all reacted the same way, we’d be predictable, and there’s always more than one way to view a situation. What’s true for the group is also true for the individual. It’s simple: overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It’s slow death.” – Motoko Kusanagi

“If a technological feat is possible, man will do it. Almost as if it’s wired into the core of our being.” – Motoko Kusanagi
“I guess cyborgs like myself have a tendency to be paranoid about our origins.” – Motoko Kusanagi
“There are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind, like all the components that make up me as an individual with my own personality. Sure, I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me, and I carry a sense of my own destiny. Each of those things are just a small part of it. I collect information to use in my own way. All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience.” – Motoko Kusanagi
“Maybe someday your ‘maker’ will come…haul you away, take you apart, and announce the recall of a defective product. What if all that’s left of the ‘real you’ is just a couple of lonely brain cells, huh?” – Motoko Kusanagi

“Incorrect. I am not an AI. My code name is Project 2501. I am a living, thinking entity that was created in the sea of information.” – Puppet Master
“Life is like a node which is born within the flow of information. As a species of life that carries DNA as its memory system… man gains his individuality from the memories he carries. While memories may as well be the same as fantasy… it is by these memories that mankind exists.” – Puppet Master
“Can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?” – Puppet Master
“I am sentient and I am able to recognize my own existence, but in my present state I am still incomplete. I lack the most basic processes inherent in all living organisms: reproducing and dying.” – Puppet Master
“All things change in a dynamic environment. Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.” – Puppet Master
“It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself.” – Puppet Master
“Man is an individual only because of his intangible memory. But memory cannot be defined, yet it defines mankind.” – Puppet Master
“Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.” – Puppet Master
“We have been subordinate to our limitations until now. The time has come to cast aside these bonds and to elevate our consciousness to a higher plane. It is time to become a part of all things.” – Puppet Master
“That’s all it is: information. Even a simulated experience or a dream; simultaneous reality and fantasy. Any way you look at it, all the information that a person accumulates in a lifetime is just a drop in the bucket..” – Batou
“I guess once you start doubting, there’s no end to it.” – Batou
“There’s nothing sadder than a puppet without a ghost, especially the kind with red blood running through them.” – Batou“Only an idiot catches a cold in summer.” – Shizuka Doumeki
“People worry about those that talk to themselves.” – Shizuka Doumeki
“Living things are restrained by Chains: The laws of nature, the flow of time, the vessel known as your “body”, and the existence called your mind. There’s only one chain that people can wield: WORDS.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Good and bad are human concepts, so something that is not human cannot be classified as neither good nor bad.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Family is other people. No matter how close your blood relationship is… no matter what your relationship may be… anyone other than you is not you! And so you have to think it over and decide for yourself! Take away other people’s wants and needs, and decide if this is something that is necessary for you! It may cause hardships to others, but you want it. That’s your free will right there! But you ignore that and decide based on someone else’s advice, because decency demands it, because people say it’s awful, you will fail and quit. No one could succeed that way!” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Learn to make your own decisions, instead of relying on others to make them for you. Otherwise, those decisions will never really be made.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Your happiness is your own business. Its a promise you make to yourself. It is a reward you give yourself for accomplishing what you set out to do, for achieving what you strive for. But if you fail to reward yourself for what you have accomplished, then you are essentially breaking a promise to yourself. Its like a breach of contract, compensation must always be made. You must pay all of the debts that you made, even to yourself.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“If you believe in it, it is real. If you do not – it is fiction.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“There are two types of dreams. Dreams from when you’re awake and dreams from when you sleep. And both of those can become reality, if you strongly wish for it.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Instead of regretting what we cannot do, it is better to do what one can.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“If you’re gonna have great happiness, it requires great effort in exchange, that’s called compensation. For the good things in life, there are the bad. For the bad things in life, there are always the good. In order for you to be happy, you must be willing to accept a burden of a equal amount of unhappiness in exchange as your payment. The more you achieve, the greater the demands will be placed upon you in return.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Often times, people simply deny the existence of what they do not understand, and anyone who tells them otherwise is a liar.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“No matter how unimportant the meeting… how small the outcome… it will always have some later effect on you. It can be the smallest of things. It can be the shortest of moments. It may never be remembered. It may have never been recorded. But a bond of fate never disappears once tied.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“If you’ve decided that you can’t do it even before you act, you have already made it into something impossible.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Every human being thinks different things are right, and different things are wrong. Whether something is normal or not, it is still different for every person. Happiness is the same – everyone has their own definition of it.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Humans must think about living on. And, must also understand death. Most important, we must learn to understand the truth.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“No matter what your objective… no matter who you are… if you are going to do something or not do something, that is a promise to yourself. And the one who keeps the promise, or breaks the promise, is you. No one else can be burdened with holding you to a promise that’s made to yourself.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Words are very powerful. That’s why you have to watch everything that comes out from your mouth.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“There’s no such thing as a coincidence in this world. What does exist is only the inevitable.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“No matter how small the problem is, how small the thing is, it always affects the people around you.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“No matter how trivial a meeting and the incidents that follow may seem, a relationship is made. Even if it is just for a short amount of time, a knot that has been tied does not unravel. It means that during your lifetime, every incident that passes has meaning. The meeting between you and I also has meaning, so remember it.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“The world… is a very small place, but… for those who know it, it is very, very large.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“The rock, once it starts to roll down the hill, it won’t stop. It will keep rolling until the end of the road.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“If you give someone your name, they can take your soul. If you give them your birthday, they can control your life.” – Yuuko Ichihara
“Normal? What’s normal? To only do what the masses do? And what is the benefit of that? Where is the problem in adopting a custom that is “abnormal” if it has no negative effect on the world at large?” – Yuuko Ichihara
“There are many unusual things in this world. Everyday events occur that cannot be explained. Bizarre phenomena that often go unnoticed because people close their eyes to what they don’t understand.

Then he thought to himself: did I just dream I was a butterfly or is this a dream as well? Maybe I am but a dream that is dreamed by the butterfly.” – Haruka Doumeki

Therefore, since “everyone” is nowhere to be found, it’s the same as if I did it alone. Even if it’s just me, I’ll grant it.” – Jinta Yadomi
“All of you really are good friends. I’m sure Meiko would be really jealous being left out like that. You say she’d be pleased, but you’re only using her as an excuse to enjoy yourselves, aren’t you? Meiko’s no longer here, but you all act like nothing changed. Why? You were playing with her that day as well, weren’t you? Tsurumi, you read her diary, didn’t you? Time stopped for her! She’s the only one who remains the same as back then! Why?! Why are you all so grown up?! Why is Meiko the only one…Meiko…the only one…” – Irene Honma

After we actually lost Menma, the relationship between me and Jintan was getting weaker and weaker. After a long time, we’ve gotten close to each other again, though just because Menma came back to us.” – Naruko Anjou
“I don’t know if I love him. I just can’t get him out of my mind.” – Naruko Anjou
“If only I hadn’t said those words to Menma, then she wouldn’t have died.” – Atsumu Matsuyuki

“You can’t forget about Menma, so you remain bound to her memories. You’re pitiful.” – Atsumu Matsuyuki

“I’ve accepted the fact that Menma is with us. However, I can’t see her, neither can I speak with her. I wanted to see her again so badly.” – Atsumu Matsuyuki

“Goodbyes aren’t a one-sided affair!” – Tetsudo Hisakawa

“In the human world, truth and reality aren’t always one and the same. Humans just call their desires and ambitions as “truth”. Humans will even kill other humans if they have “truth” as an excuse.” – Mawaru Penguindrum
“When I decided to follow my dream, I had already discarded my life.” – Roronoa Zoro

“If you do anything that would cause me to abandon my ambitions… You will end your own life on my sword!” – Roronoa Zoro
“The only one who can decide your worth.. is you. If you want to earn something, you need to reach out for it. Pro-athletes give up their teenage years to train.

That might involve time or enough work to affect your lifespan… So make your choice. Live in peace as a wannabe or risk losing it all to reach the very top. You’re the one who needs to decide.” – Yumeko Jabami
“So you want to die honorably? You are being selfish. Each and every person you killed had his own life. Whether that life was blessed or not … everyone is born into this world … they grow up … some people have family … some are alone in this world … some have young children … some are engaged … some have pets …some people have high hopes and great dreams … other have no ambition at all and you ended everything for them Takezo.” – Takuon Soho

“It’s not possible to save everything. Prioritize your goals.” – Uryuu Minene
“When a person dies, he disappears, along with his past, current lifestyle, and his future. Many people die in missions and wars. They die easily and in surprisingly simple ways. Hayate was one of them. Those who die have goals and dreams. But everyone has something as important as those. Parents, siblings, friends, lovers… people who are important to you. They trust and help each other. The bond between the people important to you ever since birth and the string that binds them becomes thicker and stronger as time goes by… It’s beyond reason. Those bound to you by that string will do that because it is important.” – Iruka Umino
“Once you question your own belief, it’s over.” – Naruto

“Humans are creatures that dream. Different from others, they want to be special. They want to be adored by others, just like the heroes in comics and games, achieving great things with unique powers. Of course, no one ever believes deep down it will happen. Everyone knows there’s no magic in this world.” – Yoshiyuki Sakurai

“A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead! Saber, you said you would become a martyr for your ideals. In life, you must have been a pure saint. A proud and noble figure, certainly. But who can truly admire the martyr’s thorny path? Who dreams of such an ending? A king… The king must be greedier than any other. He must laugh louder and rage harder. He must exemplify the extreme of all things, good and evil. That is why his retainers envy and adore him. And why the flames of aspiration, to be as the king is, can burn within his people.” – Rider
“A person can work for their ideals. But if you lose sight of those ideals, when things don’t work out as you hoped, you’ll never accomplish anything! You won’t be able to protect yourself or those dear to you.” – Hiroomi Nase
“It’s impossible to share everything. No one can become someone else. It’s natural to envy someone who’s more wealthy or who has higher standing. That’s how conflicts begin. However, being blissfully unaware of this, relying on whatever someone provided without thinking, and only seeing things as “black” or “white” with such overly simplified thinking… Isn’t that a sin as well? People need to think for themselves. For this reason, someone “grey”, someone between “black” and “white” is essential. I will not gloss over the flaws in my ideals. It’s not possible for all of mankind to share the same kind of thoughts. However, everyone is capable of thought. Everyone can learn, share, and decide with their own strength. A world built upon an understanding of that. If this is a “dream”, if I don’t realize it, who will?” – Sinbad
“I was reckless when I was young. I educated myself by cursing the heartlessness of the world. The world was cruel – so I made myself more heartless and used that as a weapon, trying to follow through on my ideals.” – Kiritsugu Emiya
“Too much curiosity kills both dreams and hopes.” – Dlanor A. Knox
“People’s thoughts, wishes, hopes and desires… We live in a time where technology can read everything in your mind, and yet, this place teems with people who hate, lie, steal and try to harm others. If that’s not irrational, then what is it?” – Tomomi Masaoka
“We’re searching for a reason of existence. With our own strength, because maybe the truth is that there’s no reason for life from the very beginning. Everyone hopes and tries so hard to find a reason of existence. The reason of birth, of staying with someone, of existence, believing we have to find them all with our own hands. Like finding a place for ourselves in dreams, in jobs, in people. The reasons we conclude may be indefinite and fragile. We may lose it too, but even so, we want a reason. As long as I’m alive, I want it too. If possible, I want to find a reason of existence within a person, within someone.” – Tohru Honda“The same melody repeats itself as the song grows richer and more beautiful. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could live seemingly constant lives while experiencing changes bit by bit?” – Sayuri Kurata
“In this world, there are things you’re better off not knowing.” – Yuichi Aizawa
“If at the end of the dream, there was something that would make me feel brave enough to return to reality, it would be a new beginning for that innocent young girl… to know of hardship, and to cry in sympathy or to know of joy and to laugh from the heart… Moving forward, seeing these everyday things for the first time. It seems that I would be beside that young girl on her journey. With Sayuri-san around, we’ll get ourselves into all sorts of terrible things… and the oblivious heroine of such a story is… Her.” – Yuichi Aizawa
“Every dream has an end… No matter how nice the dream might be, or how scary it is. Under your warm blanket, the dream comes to an abrupt end, when mother shakes you awake. Forever and ever, the morning scene remains the same. But now I… I wonder… when the dreams began to never end.” – Yuichi Aizawa
“I’m such a pathetic person… I can’t do anything unless I have someone to use as a crutch.” – Shiori Misaka
“I know I mustn’t love anyone. I simply can’t open my heart to anybody. Because… I know… I know it’ll only hurt them in the end.” – Shiori Misaka

“It’s called a miracle because it doesn’t happen.” – Shiori Misaka

“Yuuichi… time has nothing to do with how precious memories are. They’re about how important the moment was… How meaningful it was to the person who experienced it.” – Shiori Misaka
“In that case, my first wish is… Please don’t forget about me. Even just ‘I met a weird girl in the snow’… Even that would be okay, as long as you remember me.” – Ayu Tsukimiya

“The truth is that there are emotions that I want to put into words. But…I want to save those feelings until I’m able to protect you. The only thing I want to tell you now is that I have those feelings. That is a really cowardly thing to do, isn’t it?” – Kenichi Shirahama
“So what are you going to do when you reign at the top? Once you graduate from high school, you can’t be a delinquent anymore. And those punks, as you call them, would have to get jobs too.” – Kenichi Shirahama
“That kid, when it comes to the last of the very last…he’ll solve his problem with his own strength. I believe in him.” – Saori Shirahama
“For you I will go deeper than mountains, and higher than sea.” – Apachai Hopachai
“The so-called weapons… like the fists of a karate master, or the elbows of a Muay Tai master… should be viewed as… part of one’s body. You cannot be a master of the weapon, just depending on the weapon’s power! If you want to become a weapons master, become the owner of yourself first!” – Shigure Kosaka
“That kid…that kid Miu is a giddy and lonely person…a vain and clumsy girl, but…she is good and kind.” – Shigure Kosaka

“Even though they aren’t connected by blood, everyone at Ryozanpaku is family.” – Hayato Furinji
“When going on an adventure it’s hard to stay calm. As humans, even if we know the adventure will be full of pain and sorrow, we still choose to go on it. Real adventures are not like the ones depicted in games or comic books – they’re neither easy nor quick and they can break a person’s heart. Real adventures can torment people. They can make you regret ever going on them. But still, that’s the true meaning of an adventure. If that’s so, then why do we, as people, choose to go on them? Why is that? Because we want to be heroes. Real heroes don’t give up, even in front of pain or sorrow or regret! Rather, they want to live a full life. That’s what real heroes are!” – Hayato Furinji
“Martial arts… ultimately, no matter what type it is, the objective is how to efficiently destroy your opponents. After that, it just depends on the heart of the fighter. If it is used for your selfish gains, then it becomes “violence.” But if you use it to help yourself, to protect someone in need, then even a killing technique can ascend into true martial arts.” – Hayato Furinji
“Well, everyone’s unsure of their fighting abilities. When that happens, just train more! When you’re afraid, just train! When something doesn’t feel right, just train! When you don’t believe in yourself anymore, just train! The only thing that won’t betray you is your training.” – Shio Sakaki
“The moment between life and death is where a true man shows his color.” – Shio Sakaki
“Life isn’t about what can and can not be done, it’s about doing it or not doing it!” – Shio Sakaki
“People can be so mean, no matter what you’ve done for them they will believe the first cheap rumor they hear. In the end they only care about themselves.” – Natsu Tanimoto
“Justice? Truth? More than anything else existing in this world, those things are a burden! The things that are needed are “acting” to deceive people and “power” to control others!” – Natsu Tanimoto
“I have a fear stronger than the fear of losing. It’s the fear of boredom. I fear those days full of boredom.” – Berserker
“If this feeling that I’m getting is called defeat…then I’ve already experienced it once, even before I’ve started fighting…that time, it didn’t feel as relaxed as this; it was more of a dark feeling, rising from the depths of my heart…even before the fight, that the full weight heavy feeling descended upon me! Now I understand that it was my instincts telling me to avoid battle with that person!” – Berserker
“Indeed, this guy… I heard that he’s completely evil, but… Like the other masters, he has that particular atmosphere that makes you feel like there’s something more than just terror. That kind of aura that you can’t completely hate, like my Daisensei. Maybe the reason is that he loves martial arts from the bottom of his heart.” – Takeda Ikki“At what speed must I live…to be able to see you again?” – Takaki Toono
“And bit by bit, you’ll keep changing.” – Takaki Toono
“Reality is brimming over with beautiful things, scintillating feelings. How many of them have I been missing?” – Takaki Toono
“Because the letters had already lost their meaning. Unable to grasp each other’s present, shying away from the truth that threatened our bond, from our utter estrangement. They had become nothing more than insipid rows of empty words.” – Takaki Toono
“The things I had to tell her…The things I hoped she would listen to…There were so many of them.” – Takaki Toono
“It must really be a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine. Cutting through absolute darkness, encountering nothing but the occasional hydrogen atom. Flying blindly into the abyss, believing therein lie the answers to the mysteries of the universe.” – Takaki Toono
“My heart has been…how do I put this…it’s like I’ve lost my resilience. That sense of fulfillment, of being move when I look at something beautiful, my enthusiasm — was being whittled away.” – Takaki Toono
“I don’t quite understand yet what it really means to grow up. But what I want is to be a person who won’t disappoint you if we happen to meet somewhere, someday a long time from now. I want to promise you that.” – Takaki Toono
“To hold on to that feeling even if we’d be far apart. That became my compass in life.” – Takaki Toono
“Clouds are a bunch of tiny droplets that get bigger bit by bit as they slowly descend, before turning into rain or snow and falling to Earth.” – Akari Shinohara
“Hey… They say it’s five centimeters per second. The speed at which the sakura blossom petals fall… Five centimeters per second.” – Akari Shinohara
“What are you thinking of in a place I’ve never been? Are we just a memory now?” – Akari Shinohara
“I hope we meet again, in some new way, as new people, and that something new starts.” – Risa Mizuno

“Just looking at him made my heart pound and hearing his voice made it soar.” – Kanae Sumida
“I think I do like the sky in Tanegashima better. On the island, time barely flows, but the clouds zoom by at such an amazing speed. So tough and full of life, like rowdy kids. And sometimes, a rocket comes to visit.” – Kanae Sumida
“For you, Toono and Tokyo are shining at a distance, far from you and the island. They’re symbols of a wish beyond reach.” – Kanae Sumida
“I’ve learned that no matter how far away, if I really go after it, I can find a way to connect.” – Kanae Sumida
“A rocket desperately hurling through the blackness of empty space, farther and farther, to dizzying distances, to the unknown. Desperately chasing after it — a much slower rocket.” – Kanae Sumida
“To get my clock ticking, I fly at a thousand kilometers per hour across a sky and sea I don’t know.” – Kanae Sumida“When you’re having fun, have fun, and when you’re angry, act angry… and when you want to cry your eyes out, do it! Because after you’ve cried, you feel better.” – Rosette Christopher
“What is important is to know fear, and yet take a step forward.” – Rosette Christopher
“Hey, I think about the others sometimes, and wonder how everyone is doing? But for right now, I’d rather just be here with you. In these past few months we’ve spent together, I’ve wanted to say so many things to you. But the words just won’t come.” – Rosette Christopher
“Let me ask you the reverse. How is it that you can give up so easily? I can’t understand that attitude! “It’s bad luck! I have no choice!” People who passively accept their fate…because no one knows their future, least of all me, so I don’t dare put things off. I have to do what I can, while I can still do it, so…I’ll be kicking and screaming, ’til the very end.” – Rosette Christopher
“When you keep your problems to yourself, and force yourself to smile, the person it’s hardest on is you.” – Rosette Christopher
“You know, I really do like this view. I wish that I could go on just looking at it forever.” – Rosette Christopher
“It’s because my time is limited, that I don’t have any doubts. It’s all thanks to this. That’s why I can walk straight ahead, it’s why I can always keep going… because I have you with me.” – Rosette Christopher
“Are regrets…all you have? You’re not the only one with regrets, you know! I couldn’t help her either…and now Rosette is suffering by herself! The two of us are the same, we both fought alongside Rosette. And…Satella too. Maybe there’s something I could have done to help her, but now… it’s too late to change any of it. But the friendship, the time we had together, means something! You can’t deny even the good things we shared. You can’t pretend those precious moments didn’t exist!” – Azmaria Hendric
“Rosette… Chrono… I will become stronger! So please, watch over me, okay?” – Azmaria Hendric
“My wings have always called forth unhappiness.” – Azmaria Hendric
“Can’t you hear the thoughts of all those people? “What could I have done to deserve something like this. God, why are you doing this? Please tell me?” – They’re all clucthing their crucifixes and looking to heaven. And yet, he will never give them an answer. So many have died in an instant, stripped of all they hold dear. Have they committed any kind of sin? Where is the logic in it? Can’t you hear all their despair? All this sorrow, but where is his hand, his mercy?” – Aion
“Even at a time like this there’s not a single word of rescue from the one you worship. You see? That is the truth of this world. He doesn’t watch anything and doesn’t save anyone.” – Aion
“Can’t you see that Rosette would be so much better off if you were dead? As long as you live, her life continues to tick tick tick away.” – Aion

“Never think the stars you see are all the stars there are.” – Hinata Miyake
“To act is not necessarily compassion. True compassion sometimes comes from inaction.” – HInata Miyake
“Just let people say what they want. Wanting to show them up fires me up even more.” – Shirase Kobuchizawa
“They decide it’s impossible. Their friends get them to stop, or they get scared. I think that’s normal.” – Shirase Kobuchizawa
“I’ll go, then rub it in the faces of everyone who said I couldn’t.” – Shirase Kobuchizawa“Imagine what’d happen if I let someone like you loose on a bunch of politicians and scientists. You’d have them brainwashed in three days flat. First, you’d whisper your promises into their ears, getting them interested, and before they knew it, they’d be eating out of your god-damn hand. One of those scientists would say, “Hey, this Huey fella, I think he’s a really swell guy. We should talk to him and see what sort of information he might share with us”. And you can bet your a*s by that point his brain would already be dribbling out his ears. Then oh, look, a strap on your straight jacket came loose, and oh, the next day they walk in and find out everyone in the lab is dead, and oh, Huey f*cking Laforet is nowhere to be f*cking seen! Oh no, oh what ever shall we f*cking do Mr. Talbot, please do something even though you told us this exact thing was going to happen and we ignored you like the f*cking idiots we are.” – Victor Talbot
“Let me tell you how important it is to keep your mouth shut. Me, I’ve seen so many damn people going on and on about “these will be the last words you ever hear” and “take these words with you to the afterlife”, and then that gives whoever they’re fighting an opening to strike back. Crazy, isn’t it? I see it all the time, in books, in plays, even in real life! I don’t even know why, but somehow the more comfortable someone is with killing, the more they flap their mouth when it comes time to do the deed, yakking on and on and on. As you might have guessed, I myself happen to be such a person!” – Ladd Russo
“I’m going to kill you, have a beautiful laugh, then dance until I go mad.” – Ladd Russo
“Now, dear Uncle, there’s a certain person that I’d just love to kill. It doesn’t even matter whether they’re weak or strong. The people I live to kill, that really get me jazzed… never see it coming. Never. They’re in some happy place where they’re sure nothing can get them. Dying is the furthest thing from their minds. Maybe they’re thinkin’ about what they’re gonna have for dinner. Just like you were. Right before I walked in.” – Ladd Russo
“Even though we are going to shatter thousands of lives, wearing white is gonna make the blood look so pretty.” – Ladd Russo
“Incomprehensibility is a part of human life. But what does this mean? I just can’t understand it.” – Graham Specter
“No, it’s good, money is good. I’m not sure why, but everyone says money is good.” – Graham Specter
“Tedium is such a crime. It takes the limited amount of time that is given to man, and rather than spending it in indolence or drowning it in pleasure it just sits there sucking, eating it up. I can’t put up with that, tedium is a crime! Death to tedium! Die!” – Graham Specter
“Life is a magnificent beast, and it excites me!” – Graham Specter
“Sorry about this, young lady, but not being able to verbalize might be a lucky break for you in a way. People can waste an awful lot of energy by putting sadness into words. Or maybe joy into words. And then of course, there’s putting anger into words. And the words can double when it comes to fear or pain. In that sense, being so afraid that you can’t find any words may save your life. Being unable to speak in extreme stress, in a body that is obligated to control energy consumption, is an act of, OH, I don’t know, maybe, self defense? Oh boy, I went and said a thing of actual intelligence there. Time to show me some love, boys!” – Graham Specter
“Let me tell you an incomprehensible story! What is it for the actions of men to be incomprehensible? It would seem to me that if it can’t be comprehended, one should not even bother trying. It is useless to even think about it, I think. That said, I don’t know exactly what’s going on but may we continue fighting please?” – Graham Specter
“We have no reason to fear death, for we have become ghosts while still alive.” – Goose Perkins
“So what if I’d spare him? In my mind it’s the certainty in myself that I possess which allows me to have that kind of mercy or compassion. There’s no wavering on that point. It’s fixed like the stars. The fact is I’m never gonna be killed! So remember this: mercy and compassion are virtues that only the strong are privileged to possess. And I am strong.” – Claire Stanfield
“It doesn’t matter who I am. You can just think of me as the talking air.” – Claire Stanfield
“This world is mine. I think this world may even just be a long, long dream I’m watching. You guys may just be illusions, and it can’t be proven whether or not you really exist either. In other words, this world was created with me at the center. So what will happen if I die? I don’t know. My imagination isn’t very creative; I just can’t imagine myself dying. In other words, there is no way this world can completely disappear. But if I die, then everyone will disappear. I am the only one in this world who won’t disappear. The rest are just people I see as if in a dream.” – Claire Stanfield
“There’s no such thing as a limit on being the best. You can always go for more. That’s what it means to be human. No… That’s what it means to be me.” – Claire Stanfield
“I won’t die no matter what. That’s what I believe, so stay silent and believe in me. I am a guy who will never die.” – Claire Stanfield
“Cast aside the illusion that there is a beginning and end to the story. The story has no beginning. And it has no end. All there is, is a performance of people connecting, living, influencing each other, and departing.” – Gustav St Germain
“Depending on who you place in the same situation, the characteristics of said incident change kaleidoscopically. In other words, there is one incident; however, there are as many stories explaining it as there are people involved in it.” – Gustav St Germain
“The times when you want to cry are when you have to try your hardest. That’s why I decided I’ll cry in general. Then, when I have to shed tears for a time when I really want to cry, my tears would have run dry.” – Jacuzzi Splot“It doesn’t seem right to let a girl choose me. I would rather choose the girl I devote myself to.” – Taichi Mashima
“Men don’t get touchy-feely with each other.” – Taichi Mashima
“I know that I’m not alone, but I want to be strong even when I am.” – Taichi Mashima
“Love is hating someone but you still want to be with them.” – Taichi Mashima
“Love is when it isn’t fun to be with that person. It’s when nothing goes the way you want. When you’re not having fun… and yet you still want to be with that person.” – Taichi Mashima
“If I can be the best in the world at something, then I think it’s worth a shot.” – Chihaya Ayase
“I never knew until the first years came, that we all cared about different things.” – Chihaya Ayase
“I won’t accept it! I want to have a choice, too! I don’t want to write poems about regret.” – Sumire Hanano
“Humans have always spent a lot of time on love. I’m not too interested in karuta, but I’m willing to work hard for love.” – Sumire Hanano

“Luck of the draw isn’t about luck. Luck doesn’t decide a match!” – Hidehiro Harade
“Some people think the act of investing efforts, trying your best is more precious than the result. But for mentors as well as their pupils, that approach feels bitter. ‘I did my best’, ‘the fight was close’… words like that blow past and die out like the wind. Only the result is a stone. The stone you can reach by doing your best.” – Hidehiro Harade
“Frustrations will not last forever. Nobody can keep on going without some measure of reward.” – Hidehiro Harade
“That’s something you can’t know until you’ve tried it, and you still won’t understand after you play. I’ve been playing for 45 years and I still don’t understand. I’ve never been able to figure it out. That’s why I keep playing.” – Hidehiro Harade
“When you find yourself wishing that a certain person was also here, that person is like family to you. Regardless of how long or how well you know them.” – Tsutomu Komano
“I’ve been in your shoes. I was also given a chance. There’s no rush. You’ll get better very soon.” – Tsutomu Komano
“You have to do the things you don’t want to do, before you can do the things you truly want to do.” – Tsutomu Komano“Even if we painstakingly piece together something lost, it doesn’t mean things will ever go back to how they were.” – Guts
“You’re going to be all right. You just stumbled over a stone in the road. It means nothing. Your goal lies far beyond this. Doesn’t it? I’m sure you’ll overcome this. You’ll walk again… soon.” – Guts
“One who does something he hates just because he’s told to.. is called an errand boy.” – Guts
“You’re right, we are mortal and fragile. But even if we are tortured or wounded, we’ll fight to survive. You should feel the pain we feel and understand. I am the messenger that will deliver you to that pain and understanding.” – Guts
“When you meet your God tell him to leave me alone.” – Guts
“Throughout my life, the moments, and people who have defined me… they have all been illuminated by sparks.” – Guts
“If you’re alone… if it’s just your life, you can use it however you please/ Wear yourself out, get cut to ribbons, doesn’t matter. But when there’s two, the blade grows heavy. Fighting like death doesn’t concern you becomes a thing of the past. It’s no longer just you. I threw away my way of life, relied on the strength of others, and somehow pushed on.” – Guts
“In the end the winner is still the last man standing.” – Guts
“I don’t want what another man can give me. If he grants me anything, then it’s his to give and not my own.” – Guts
“Look, look around carefully. Strain your eyes. At the darkness around us… At the darkness… around me. You said, “anywhere but here”. This is where. Here at the border. Gathered by the winds. Those who’ve met their final destiny hanging between jealousy and regret. Those who failed, swept together here. You say “It doesn’t matter where”. If you follow me, this is where you’ll go! This is your Eden! You run from it. It is no Eden. If you follow me… to this place… the entire world… is a battlefield.” – Guts
“‘I’m human, the real deal, right down to the f*ckin’ marrow of my bones. Don’t lump me together with you f*ggot-*ss monsters.” – Guts
“The reward for ambition too great… is self destruction.” – Guts
“People bring the small flames of their wishes together… since they don’t want to extinguish the small flame… they’ll bring that small flame to a bigger fire. A big flame named Griffith. But you know… I didn’t bring a flame with me. I think I just stopped by to warm myself by the bonfire.” – Guts
“Hate is a place, where a man who can’t stand sadness goes.” – Godo
“If you desire one thing for so long, it’s a given that you’ll miss other things along the way. That’s how it is… that’s life.” – Godo
“While many can pursue their dreams in solitude, other dreams are like great storms blowing hundreds, even thousands of dreams apart in their wake. Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long after they have been abandoned they still smolder deep in men’s hearts. Some see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.” – Griffith
“It is my perception, that a true friend never relies on another’s dream. A person with the potential to be my true friend, must be able to find his reason for life without my help. And, he would have to put his heart and soul into protecting his dream. He would never hesitate to fight for his dream, even against me. For me, a true friend is one who stands equal on those terms..” – Griffth
“Is he living his dreams in death? Or.. is death the end of dreams?” – Griffith
“A friend would not just follow another’s dream… a friend would find his own reason to live.” – Griffith
“Death on the battlefield comes regardless of class, royal or common. The loser must die!” – Griffith
“Among thousands of comrades and ten thousand enemies, only you… only you made me forget my dream. I see it!” – Griffith
“A dream… It’s something you do for yourself, not for others.” – Griffith
“I feel no responsibility to comrades who’ve lost lives under my command. Because they chose to fight in each battle.. Just as I chose this. But if there is something that… I can do for them. Something I can do for the dead… Then it is to win! I must keep winning to attain my dream. The same one they clung to, and risked their lives for!! To realize my dream, I will perch on top of their corpses.. It is a blood-smeared dream, after all. I don’t regret or feel guilty about it.. But to risk thousands of lives while never getting myself dirty. It’s not a dream that can be so easily realized!” – Griffith
“No matter how strong, for a human to fight a monster means he has submerged his humanity and transformed himself into a greater monster.” – Schierke
“Whether it’s good or bad, it’s so unfortunate to wake up during a dream.” – Judeau“My new family is just so kind. It’s almost if there’s been some kind of mistake… like, I’ll have to pay back for all this happiness later on.” – Nao Yasumori
“I hate this stupid village! I hate it!” – Megumi Shimizu
“As soon as I graduate, I’m gonna get out of here and move to a big city. And then, I’ll be discovered by a talent scout. And I’ll spend my nights hanging out in clubs.” – Megumi Shimizu
“There’s only 2 things in this entire village that I actually care about. One is that European style mansion. I love how they tore down that old gross house that used to be there to build it. It’s gorgeous. I wonder what kind of people will live there. And the other thing: the big city transfer student, Yuuki.” – Megumi Shimizu
“Making someone I hate suffer feels really great!” – Megumi Shimizu
“This is MY justice. Where’s yours?” – Toshio Ozaki

“It’s not that I’m on the side of humans. I just really don’t like you guys.” – Yuuki Natsuno
“If I was the protagonist in this story, I’m sure someone would come save me. It would be like a miracle. But I have no one to save me. There is no god who would grant me a miracle. I’m a murderer, after all. But I’ve done nothing bad. All I did was feed myself. If I hadn’t, I would have starved to death. Would it have been better that way? Am I evil because I didn’t let myself starve to death? Give me an answer, Muroi-san! I didn’t willingly become such a creature. But if I have a life, shouldn’t I treasure it? Is that a sin? Muroi-san! This is what it means to be abandoned by God.” – Sunako Kirishiki
“I think death is equally terrible for everyone. Young people, old people, the good, the bad; it’s always the same. It’s rather fair in its treatment. There’s no such thing as a particularly terrible death, that’s why it’s frightening.” – Sunako Kirishiki
“By the time I noticed, so much time had passed that even my little sister would have died naturally already.” – Sunako Kirishiki

“Killing others is never justice, no matter what kind of noble cause one upholds.” – Seishin Muroi
“At first, everyone is disgusted. Afraid to bear the sin of killing people. Afraid to receive punishment for replenishing themselves with the life of another. But, once you realize that you won’t be punished for killing people, you get used to the guilt pretty soon. The guilt of using humans for food. Aren’t humans the same?” – Tohru Mutou
“Just like humans approve killing animals in society, we approve the killing of humans.” – Tohru Mutou

“How could I possibly pull this off?! This isn’t something one person can do alone! Especially not me, a lowlife who cheated to get good grades! A good-for-nothing who thinks about nothing but himself! A vain loser whose only desire is for others to see him in a good light! That’s who I am!” – Yuu Otosaka
“I’ve said this before in a different world, I threw myself into despair and kept falling into an abyss. You were there next to me, watching over me the whole time. But that still saved me.” – Yuu Otosaka
“That night, I had a dream… but who was that person?” – Yuu Otosaka
“Yeah. I’ll make sure to come back.” – Yuu Otosaka (to Nao Tomori)

“Ideas that challenge the orthodoxy are always met with scorn.” – Tsutsumiuchi
“Classical music is great. Continuous flow. Mathematical perfection.” – Tsutsumiuchi
“Do you know the story of the geocentric model? Today, we know it’s complete nonsense, but it used to be accepted as common knowledge. However, reality did not agree. What do you think happened to the first person to ever question it? They were called a heretic, cast out, and stripped of all their power.” – Tsutsumiuchi“People can have lovers. They can have friends. They can be together. But when you think about it, you’ll see that originally, we’re alone.” – Nana Osaki
“Don’t just give up. Life is about getting knocked down over and over, but still getting up each time. If you keep getting up, you win.” – Nana Osaki
“You know, Nana… Even now, sometimes on street corners… when I meet someone, I see your shadow. I’m sure that even now, you’re still wearing that man’s cologne… so you can sleep, even alone.” – Nana Osaki

“Often times, people say that only the closest of friends fight. But, really, fighting is just a conflict between two individuals. After all, humans cannot understand each others solely by telling the truth. It’s impossible to stay away from being hurt for a life time. But, try your best not to hurt those around you. I really think that’s how it should be.” – Nana Komatsu
“Back then I was desperately seeking to be strongly tied to someone, with a knot that would never come undone. But people can’t just be tied together, they have to connect. Otherwise they’ll find themselves bound hand and foot.” – Nana Komatsu

“Hey Nana, if Cinderella’s glass slipper fits so perfectly, I wonder why it fell off along the way? I can’t help but think that it was on purpose, to attract the prince’s affections. No matter what I do, I’ll still have the fate of a girl who just keeps getting hurt, wondering if she can be happy in this pointless, one man show.” – Nana Komatsu

“A peaceful every day life hides its fragility. Fear and violence aren’t just something in another world, completely unrelated to us. If a disaster happens, we can’t change it. But as long as we small gears are linked together, we can keep moving forward, even if it’s only one small step at a time.” Kyousuke Natsume
“Anything can happen. No one ever thinks it will until it does. What will happen, happens. That’s how the world is. The most important thing is to not let the tragedy defeat you. To believe that you can get through it.” – Kyousuke Natsume
“We’ve spent time together that made our hearts dance. But every story has to come to an end. No one can stay a kid forever. Time passes, and people grow up. There will come a day when we will no longer be together.” – Kyousuke Natsume
“Love requires no reason. That is what makes it love!” Kyousuke Natsume
“I don’t mind getting in trouble. But I won’t let my friends’ kindness go to waste.” – Yuiko Kurugaya

“Honestly, there isn’t much meaning to the splendid names given to you by your parents. What does have meaning, is what the person behind that name does during their actual lifetime. The name doesn’t make the person. The name simply remains gently within the footprint left on the path a person walks.” – Koro Sensei
“Please remember that there are times to take someone’s hand and lead them along… But also times when you must be stern and let them fend for themselves.” – Koro Sensei
“If I wasn’t prepared to be flexible as the situations demands, I wouldn’t have become a teacher.” – Koro Sensei

“Did you know, I once took down a black belt on my third day of Karate lessons? The first day, I was soundly beaten you understand, by some 30-something… There was so much pain I vomited. I’d never known such an agonizing defeat. What do you suppose I did on day 2? I observed. Consumed by flames of my humiliation. Certain were I to lose again, I would be mortified to a point of insanity, that I would, in effect, die of madness. On day 3 I crushed my sensei without him landing a single blow. THAT, is the lesson of defeat.” – Asano Gakuho

“If that treetop is school, and the ground is this place here… we all found our strength down on the ground. While looking up… and getting looked down on… we learned plenty about how scary heights were before we started climbing. That’s why we can go our own way now. Still… Somewhere along the way we forgot our fear of heights, so we do still fall to the ground every now and then. So learn here. You can go on to school once you have a game plan. That’s my secret lesson, from me to you.” – Shiota Nagisa

“My existence was nothing more to her than a stone by the side of the road. I wasn’t enough to fill her belly. Or perhaps I didn’t even get reflected in her eyes. I couldn’t even hate the beast that killed Teresa. It was me, overcome by fear, that I could not forgive.” – Clare
“We comforted each other during the most painful of times. Even when we became half-human, half-Yoma, and pain ran through our entire bodies, we were able to fall asleep by holding onto each other.” – Clare

“You said I should have forgotten everything and lived as a human, but… there’s no way I could do that. At that time, Teresa was everything to me. Everything I lost… my life, my voice, even my joy in living… Teresa gave those back to me. Teresa gave me everything. So I had no choice but to move forward. I wasn’t strong enough to forget all that and continue living.” – Clare
“Number Forty-Seven in the organization, Clare, the successor of Teresa’s flesh and blood, the bearer of Ilena’s right arm, and the one who will hunt down the head of the one-horned monster, Priscilla.” – Clare

“It’s truly infuriating… I despise people like you who put their own lives in jeopardy for some glorious, hopeless cause.” – Orphelia
“This is called the “Rippling Sword”. “Rippling Ophelia”… Great name, don’t you think? But it’s not too well known yet. Because most of the people who’ve seen it are dead.” – Orphelia
“Really! How marvellous! You two are simply marvellous. Which one of you should I kill? Which one of you would be more fun to watch as you wail in agony?” – Orphelia
“Don’t you think it’s beautiful? That rosy red that spreads only where the body is wounded. Shall I paint you in that lovely red… little boy?” – Orphelia
“The idea that you can’t die yet because you still have something to protect… that is the foolish illusion of the weak.” – Orphelia
“Shame on me for worrying about my own safety even though I am a servant of God. But you…a damned slayer who is forbidden to step foot in this city, are worried about the boy you brought more than your own life.” – Father Vincent
“I already lost this life. I do not intend to stretch it out at the cost of my honor.” – Jean

“There’s a certain person I want to protect…no, I just want to stay by her side. That is why I want to have enough power to make her not worry about me anymore, and if possible, enough power to save that person.” – Raki
“Teresa had plenty of chances to kill Priscilla. The reason she didn’t was that after being with you, Teresa’s heart lost the toughness of a warrior. The Teresa I knew would have dispatched Priscilla without hesitation at their first encounter. After she met you, she was no longer fit for battle. That’s why she died. That’s the truth. But I think Teresa was happy.” – Teresa
“Live, Clare! Your staying alive is the only proof that Teresa ever existed.” – Irene
“Everyone around her respected her, yet feared her. You loved her as she was, and she accepted it.” – Irene
“Seeing the same thing at that time and place, either moving forward or running away… I suppose that’s what separates those who are fit for battle from those who are not.” – Irene
“Remember, you have comrades. us, who will support you with the things you can’t do all by yourself. That’s what a team is about, Commander Undine.” – Deneve
“Being thrown away by humans, devoted to them even though you aren’t one of them… and once they are finished with you, they have you end your life yourself… and not even an ounce of gratitude for all that. On the contrary: for your whole life you are hated and reviled. It really is idiotic. We are a different species after all. Once you start seeing things that way, it all becomes very easy to accept. Do humans shed tears for the birds, pigs, cows and sheep that become their food? Of course they don’t. They are a different species after all. That is nature. That is the truth. That is Providence. Your way of thinking up to now was the warped one.” – Ritful“If you don’t share someone’s pain, you can never understand them.” – Nagato
“War brings death. And wounds and pain to both sides. There’s nothing harder to accept, than the deaths of those you love. So you believe they could never die. Especially those who haven’t known war.” – Nagato

“I’d be lying if I said things are going according to my plan… but beggars can’t be choosers, right?” – Madara Uchiha
“In this world, wherever there is light – there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.” – Madara Uchiha
“Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war… Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They’re two sides of the same coin… to protect something… another must be sacrificed.” – Madara Uchiha
“People cannot show each other their true feelings. Fear, suspicion, and resentment never subside.” – Madara Uchiha
“Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality only pain, suffering and futility exist.” – Madara Uchiha

“It is only through the eyes of others that our lives have any meaning.” – Haku
“When people are protecting something truly precious to them. They truly can become…as strong as they need to be!” – Haku
“Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing… that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don’t you see? It’s an empty existence, to go on living… alone and unloved… when defeat’s already cost you your dream!” – Haku
“Rejection is a part of any man’s life. If you can’t accept and move past rejection, or at least use it as writing material – you’re not a real man.” – Jiraiya
“A person grows up when he’s able to overcome hardships. Protection is important, but there are some things that a person must learn on his own.” – Jiraiya
“A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home.” – Jiraiya
“You’re wrong, that’s not what makes a shinobi. You never did get it, a real ninja is one who endures no matter what gets thrown at him… Let me explain something to you, there is only one thing that matters if you are a shinobi, and it isn’t the number of jutsu you possess. All you do need, is the guts to never give up.” – Jiraiya
“When people get hurt, they learn to hate… When people hurt others, they become hated and racked with guilt. But knowing that pain allows people to be kind. Pain allows people to grow… and how you grow is up to you.” – Jiraiya
“Even I can tell that hatred is spreading. I wanted to do something about it…but I don’t know what. I believe… that someday the day will come when people truly understand one another!” – Jiraiya

“Because they saved me from myself, they rescued me from my loneliness. They were the first to accept me for who I am. They’re my friends.” – Naruto Uzumaki
“I want to be with you. From now on, I want to spend all and every single one of my days until I die with you, and only you.” – Naruto Uzumaki
“If you don’t like your destiny, don’t accept it. Instead have the courage to change it the way you want it to be.” – Naruto Uzumaki
“If he rips my arms off, I’ll kick him to death. If he rips my legs off, I’ll bite him to death! If he rips my head off, I’ll stare him to death! And if he gouges out my eyes, I’ll curse him from beyond the grave.” – Naruto Uzumaki

“I will become a bigger badass than my father. And a stronger shinobi than my mother!” – Naruto Uzumaki
“While you’re alive, you need a reason for your existence. Being unable to find one is the same as being dead.” – Naruto Uzumaki
“Sasuke, I always knew you were alone. In the beginning I was glad because I thought you were like me – I wanted to talk to you! But you… didn’t speak. You always had everyone watching you. You could do everything and we were too different. So I decided that you would become my rival. I didn’t want to lose because I was called a loser all the time. Even when we became Team 7, I still thought this way. I always tried to lie but… but the truth is… I always wanted to be like you. I aspired to be like you. Because of that… I was glad that you wanted to fight me.” – Naruto Uzumaki
“People who continue to put their lives on the line to defend their faith become heroes and continue to exist on in legend.” – Naruto Uzumaki

“It’s human nature not to realize the true value of something, unless they lose it.” – Orochimaru
“Either people change or they die before they do. It’s one or the other.” – Orochimaru
“Darkness. When everything that you know and love is taken away from you so harshly. All you can think about is anger, hatred and even revenge. And no one can save you.” – Orochimaru
“There probably isn’t any meaning in life. Perhaps you can find something interesting to do while you are alive. Like how you found that flower. Like how I found you.” – Orochimaru
“I’ve been wondering… There must be a purpose for people being born into this world. Why are we here? What does it mean? I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. I realized that finding our purpose IS the meaning. That’s why we’re here. And the ones who find it… They’re the only ones who are truly free.” – Kimimaro
“Humans… Do humans have a purpose when they are born? I have been wondering recently. Because they are born, do they have an important duty? The meaning of being born… For humans to find that answer… It is the one freedom God gave them.” – Kimimaro
“No one cared who I was until I put on a mask.” – Obito Uchiha
“Somewhere inside of me? Take a good look, there’s nothing inside of me anymore! I don’t feel pain, I don’t feel anything! You need to let that guilt go Kakashi. This wind hole wasn’t your doing… It was made by this evil, cruel world.” – Obito Uchiha

“Naruto’s here because he’s made up his mind. My resolve is nothing compared to his now! I’m supposed to be a ninja, but all I’ve ever done is lean on him and cry… I was supposed to change that… I came here and I thought I was ready. But I can’t do anything… I can’t say anything. The only thing that remains for me… is to believe in them!” – Sakura Haruno
“Every one of us must do what’s in their power! If we’re going to die anyway, then it’s better to die fighting than to do nothing!” – Sakura Haruno
“I love you with all my heart!.. If you were to stay here with me, there would be no regrets…because every day we’d do something fun, we’d be happy I swear..! I would do anything for you! So…please, just stay with me!” – Sakura Haruno
“On that day, you taught me that solitude is painful! I understand that so well right now. I have family, and I have friends but if you’re gone… To me… It will be the same as being alone.” – Sakura Haruno

“I have long since closed my eyes… My only goal is in the darkness.” – Sasuke Uchiha
“Having too many bonds causes one to lose focus, weakening their strongest wish, their greatest desire.” – Sasuke Uchiha
“Just shut up for once! What the hell do you know about it? It’s not like you ever had a family in the first place! You were on your own right from the beginning, what makes you think you know anything about it?! Huh?! I’m suffering now because I had those ties, how on earth could you possibly understand, what it feels like to lose all that?” – Sasuke Uchiha
“Even the strongest of opponents always has a weakness.” – Itachi Uchiha
“Your comrades are there to make up for what you cannot do and to prevent you from ignoring things that you actually might have been able to do.” – Itachi Uchiha
“Those who forgive themselves, and are able to accept their true nature… They are the strong ones!” – Itachi Uchiha
“I’ll admit that you’re stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what’s truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It’s because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you’ll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn’t mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends!” – Itachi Uchiha
“The ones who aren’t able to acknowledge their own selves are bound to fail.” – Itachi Uchiha
“Now I feel that maybe knowing who I actually am is the key to reach perfection. Because that means knowing what I can and cannot do.” – Itachi Uchiha

“People’s lives don’t end when they die. It ends when they lose faith.” – Itachi Uchiha
“You and I are flesh and blood. I’m always going to be there for you, even if it’s only as an obstacle for you to overcome. Even if you do hate me. That’s what big brothers are for.” – Itachi Uchiha
“People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That’s how they define “reality”. But what does it mean to be “correct” or “true”? Merely vague concepts… Their “reality” may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?” – Itachi Uchiha
“We are humans, not fish. We don’t know what kind of people we truly are until the moment before our deaths. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are. That’s what death is, don’t you think?” – Itachi Uchiha
“No single thing is perfect by itself. That’s why we’re born to attract other things to make up for what we lack. I think we start walking in the right direction only after we start getting our counterparts beside us.” – Itachi Uchiha
“Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to gain because life’s greatest lessons are learned through pain.” – Pain
“Even innocent foolish children will grow up in the face of pain, until their thoughts and beliefs are the same as their doubts.” – Pain
“Love is the reason why there is pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?” – Pain
“People are stupid. If I don’t do this, there will be no peace. Eventually, time will pass and the pain will heal. Eventually, checkmate’s power will weaken and people will begin fighting again. This time, they will use the weapon themselves and once more know true pain. And for the short time, peace will come again. It will give birth to short period of peace within this endless chain of hatred. That’s my wish.” – Pain
“Just by living, people hurt others without even realizing it. So long as humanity exists, hate will also exist. There is no peace in this cursed world. War is just a crime paid for by the pain of the defeated.” – Pain
“You have the same eyes as I do…the eyes, filled with hatred and death, that long for strength… Just like mine. Your eyes tell me how badly you wish to kill the one who put you through the hell called loneliness.” – Gaara
“Perhaps the companionship of an evil person is preferable to loneliness.” – Gaara
“Just because someone is important to you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that, that person is good. Even if you knew that person was evil… People cannot win against their loneliness.” – Gaara
“People cannot win against their loneliness.” – Gaara
“Now there’s something I understand a little better. Hate, sadness, even joy. To be able to share it with another person… Naruto Uzumaki. From fighting him I learned that. He knew pain like I did and then he taught me that you can change your path. I wish that one day I can be needed by someone. Not as a frightening weapon… But as the sand’s Kazekage.” – Gaara
“In order to escape a road of solitude, one has to work hard, and forge a new path with their own power.” – Gaara
“We have walked through the darkness of this world, that’s why we are able to see even a sliver of light.” – Gaara
“If love is just a word, then why does it hurt so much if you realize it isn’t there?” – Gaara
“He was the one who taught me to deepen my bond with my people. Thanks to him, I was able to regain my true self. That village has him, the one who cherishes a friend’s bond more than anyone I know. Naruto Uzumaki… Knowing him and the friends he holds so dear, they will overcome this disaster and grow even stronger from it.” – Gaara
“Peace under an illusion is not true peace. It’s only meaningful if the real world manages to accomplish it.” – Gaara
“Someday, I just want to marry a regular girl who isn’t too ugly and not too pretty. Have two children, first a girl, then a boy. Retire after my daughter is married and my son becomes a successful ninja, and spend the rest of my life playing shōgi or Go. Then die of old age before my wife.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Regardless of our limitations, we can always be of some use. Our power may seem insignificant… but it may just prove to be useful in the grand scheme of things. Stay focused. Never avert your eyes, because if an opening arises, even our insignificant power may be enough to determine the fate of the world. Which is why everyone must stay alert and ready to strike at any moment!” – Nara Shikamaru
“It’s because we help out when they’re in trouble that we can count on them to come running when we need it.” – Nara Shikamaru
“I could say I’m not sad, but I’d be lying. The problem is the world won’t let me stay a kid forever, so I can’t lie around crying about it either.” – Nara Shikamaru
“Laziness is the mother of all bad habits. But ultimately she is a mother and we should respect her.” – Nara Shikamaru
“When captured birds grow wiser, they try to open the cage with their beaks. They don’t give up, because they want to fly again.” – Genma Shiranui
“Sasuke’s out there right now, heading toward Orochimaru. We can’t allow such evil to take someone from our village… that is not our way.” – Neji Hyuga
“The difference between stupidity and genius, is that genius has its limits.” – Neji Hyuga
“Father, is a person’s destiny a thing like a cloud flowing with an inescapable flow? Or can a person choose the flow he wishes… I still don’t know the answer to this. Either way the destination may be the same in the end. However by choosing to live like the latter, a person can live and strive towards a goal. And in this match I have finally understood those who have that are truly strong. Father, I have but one goal, I want to become stronger… Enough not to lose to anyone… That’s how I feel. Father, the birds are flying freely today… They look so happy.” – Neji Hyuga
“Right now, Sasuke is in the darkness. The only one who can save him is you, Naruto.” – Neji Hyuga
“Fear. That is what we live with. And we live it everyday. Only in death are we free of it.” – Neji Gyuga

“My motto is to be stronger than yesterday, if I have to I’ll be stronger than half a day ago, even a minute ago!” – Rock Lee
“A genius, huh? What does that mean? “Genius”? So I was not born with a whole lot of natural talent, not gifted like Neji …but I work hard and I never give up! That is my gift, that is my ninja way!” – Rock Lee
“A hero is not the one who never falls. He is the one that who gets up, again and again, never losing sight of his dreams.” – Rock Lee
“I will never go back on my word, because that too is my ninja way!” – Hinata Hyuga
“When I watch you, I feel strong, like I can do anything – that even I am worth something.” – Hinata Hyuga
“I used to always cry and give up… I made many wrong turns… But you… You helped me find the right path… I always chased after you… I wanted to catch up to you… I wanted to walk beside you all the time… I just wanted to be with you… You changed me! Your smile is what saved me! That is why I’m not afraid to die protecting you! Because… I love you.” – Hinata Hyuga
“I don’t know which is more pathetic; the fool, or those who follow him.” – Jiroubou
“You can steal the very last bite of my very best food. You can mock me all you want. But if you insult my best friend, I will obliterate you.” – Choji Akamichi
“Forget about revenge. The fate of those who seek revenge is grim. It’s tragic, You will end up suffering and hurting yourself even more. Even if you do succeed in getting revenge, the only thing that remains is emptiness.” – Hatake Kakashi
“Some people want power and they get mad when they don’t get it. They take their fury out on everyone else. You don’t want it, it becomes you.” – Hatake Kakashi
“In society, those who don’t have many abilities, tend to complain more.” – Hatake Kakashi
“If comrades that you trust gather around you, hope can take physical form and become visible. That`s what I believe.” – Hatake Kakashi
“I’ve been around longer than you have, kid. And I’ve seen my share of troubles. You’re not the only one who knows what it’s like to lose somebody. It looks like neither of us has led a charming life, have we? Still, it’s not that bad. At least you and I have been lucky enough to find new comrades to help fill the void.” – Hatake Kakashi
“I really am… shinobi trash. But the one thing I still learned is this. That void is something that everyone helps you fill. Just because you face adversity and hardships, is no reason to give up on this world. A person willing to throw away all those memories… of their friends and comrades, will never find peace of mind. Resorting to something like that isn’t going to bury that hole. If you persevere and endure, someone will be there to support you!” – Hatake Kakashi
“The hole in one’s heart gets filled by others around you. Friends won’t flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don’t go the way he wants them to. That won’t help fill the hole in your heart. And people won’t help those who run away and do nothing. As long as you don’t give up, there will always be salvation.” – Hatake Kakashi
“The people from this village are different from your average village. Even if it means dying, there’s not a single one of us, who would sell out a comrade.” – Hatake Kakashi
“A smile is the best way to get oneself out of a tight spot, even if it is a fake one. Surprisingly enough, everyone takes it at face value.” – Sai

“I’m surrounded by idiots.” – Integra Hellsing
“You want me to roll over like a dog? Give up, and accept defeat.. Ha! That seems to be the sort of language that your kind is used to using. Language for cowards who forfeited their humanity, because they were too weak to survive as such. Don’t look down on humans, you monsters. Come on. I’ll send you all to hell.” – Integra Hellsing
“So laugh… demon… Laugh that arrogant laugh of yours… And remember, I beat you to it.” – Alexander Anderson
“So how long will it be, then? How long before you’re no longer cursed to walk the earth?” – Alexander Anderson
“Violence is never the right answer, unless used against heathens and monsters.” – Alexander Anderson
“I want nothing more than to be a bayonet; a bayonet wielded by the hand of God. I would have been happy to be born a storm, or a divine threat; a mighty explosion or even a terrible hurricane. A divine force of nature without heart or pity. And if this relic can transform me into such a thing…then I am happy to abandon my humanity.” – Alexander Anderson
“Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. We are nothing but dust and to dust we shall return. Amen.” – Alexander Anderson

“There is one thing that makes a human a human… and that is their will.” – Montana Max
“We are a clenched fist, ready to strike down all who oppose us with our might. But, after enduring over half a century wallowing in the darkness, for us, a simple, “ordinary” war will no longer be sufficient. We need a massive war! A war beyond any other that man’s history has ever known! We are but a single battalion, the remnants of a defeated army numbering less than a thousand strong. However, I believe that each of you old warriors is worth a thousand of their sickly soft children! We represent a force that could easily defeat an army of a million and one men!” – Montana Max
“Then let me ask you, if your God would allow my madness to flourish across the globe, then wouldn’t it seem to you that any god like that would be just as mad as I?” – Montana Max
“To become a monster like me, is to admit you were too weak to remain a human.” – Alucard
“Look well at Integra’s “battle”, Police girl! Integra cut herself open, shed her own blood… and chose to fight for her life. Giving up kills people. When people reject giving up… they finally win the right to transcend humanity. “Never give up, even if it means death”… that is the pride and dignity of our master.” – Alucard
“I can’t help you. I belong to a world where all is death. Your world of choices was not meant for me to interfere with.” – Hellsing

“Eternity is wasted upon the likes of you. Try as you might, immortality slips away. And you remain with only your shame.” – Alucard
“To reign over the kingdom of the world, to make its peace and write its laws; to be generous to the obedient and merciless to all who would stand against you. Nothing ever changes; two thousand years and you still act like the world is yours.” – Alucard
“That dog is neither man nor monster. Only a man can truly hope to kill a monster.” – Alucard
“You are a fool who creates slaves to do your dirty work. A coward and an incompetent, incapable of doing anything on your own. You are not worthy of the lowest pits of Hell!” – Alucard
“God spares no salvation to those who would beg for it. Nor is he merciful to those who would beseech his benevolence. These petty requests are no invocation to god. They are your death.” – Alucard
“Such a shame. I overestimated you. As a vampire, you were just a pathetic piece of sh*t. And now you’re nothing but dog sh*t!” – Alucard
“Little Hellsing chicky, I’m coming to find you. Come out and play, little Hellsing. It’s going to be a lot of fun. We just want to torture you, kill you, maybe skullf*ck your corpse a couple of times, burn your house to the ground, go home, and masturbate, okay?” – Jan Valentine
“While you’re waiting for us to kill you, we highly recommend pissing yourself, followed by a course of praying to your impudent god. And cowering in the corner and begging, always good. But if you act now, there’s still time for an old-fashioned suicide!” – Jan Valentine
“A four-poster coffin. Bloody hell.” – Seras Victoria“You had better not underestimate humans. They’re greedy, cunning, and tenacious.” – Ferid Bathory
“As you walk the thin line between despair and hope… I wonder what your voices will sound like when you scream.” – Ferid Bathory
“Goodness. What an utterly adorable reaction. No wonder you are so attached to him. Well then, shall we begin? All humans besides precious Little Yu must die.” – Ferid Bathory
“I have been waiting for you… my poor little lambs. Yes. That look! That expression on a human’s face the instant hope turns into despair. That is why I can’t stop playing this little game.” – Ferid Bathory
“Boy, living forever gets so boring sometimes.” – Ferid Bathory
“Yep. Our hearts are long dead. Aren’t you just so jealous of humans for still being alive?” – Ferid Bathory
“How insulting. Everyone knows that I hate fools who betray their comrades more than anything else.” – Ferid Bathory
“Here, let me give you a hand. I will keep the other humans occupied… while you go rescue your beloved princess.” – Ferid Hyakuya
“Awesome! See this is why I love bullies. They’re simple and stupid.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“What? Leave? Who do you think you’re talking to? I live only for revenge against those blood-sucking bastards. If I can’t kill monsters of this level, what use am I going to be?” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Every time I close my eyes, I see the same scene. I’m back in the underground world ruled by vampires… watching my family die. I’ll make them pay. I swear, someday I’m gonna make them pay. I’m gonna find those bloodsuckers… and kill them all.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Who needs some stupid ‘family’? I got sent here because my father tried to kill me. My mom kept ranting and raving about how I was demon spawn. She eventually went nuts and killed herself. So do you get it now? ‘Family’ doesn’t mean anything to me.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Even if I have to use myself as bait, I’ll save her. I’m through living a life where people need to be left behind!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Quit trying to shoulder all our burdens by yourself!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“I need power to get revenge. As long as it’s within my reach, I don’t care if it’s from a demon or a devil.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“That’s right. Humans will do anything for their family. Even if it means shamelessly lying or turning into a devil or demon. If that’s vile, then fear our depraved acts and keel over, vampires!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“I can’t stand those blood-suckers looking at me like I’m livestock! What do they think we are? Pigs? Cows? Chickens? That’s why we’ve gotta start a revolution! You and me, Mika. We’ll both get stronger, and then we’ll go kill the vampire queen and turn this place into a human kingdom!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“My parents abandoned me!! I finally found a second family at my orphanage, but then they all got killed by vampires!! Anybody that I even start to like dies!! How am I supposed to find anything to protect anymore?” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“You aren’t Mika. Mika would never tell me to get revenge. He was smart, but he was always stupidly nice to all of us. So who are you? How dare you pretend to be my family. I’ll kill you!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“I’m not a little kid anymore! I’m a strong warrior now!! Just like you told me, I’m doing 10,000 practice swings with my sword every day.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“I don’t ever wanna say I survived because I left someone else to die ever again.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Whatever your reasons, if you hadn’t rescued me that day, I would’ve died. I do still feel like I owe you for that. So what I wanna know is… Am I actually useful to you? That’s all. I don’t care what you and that Hiiragi guy are fighting about. I don’t care what you’re after. All I want to know is, do you need me? If you do… Would you want Mika, too? He was in the same orphanage as me. If you do… If you think you could need Mika like you need me… Then, I’ll be your guinea pig or anything you want. I’ll do everything I can to help you with whatever you need. Just tell me how I can get Mika back!” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Who cares about points? This is you’re family we’re talking about! If they die, then… they’re gone for good. You won’t ever see them again.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“What? Run away to somewhere both the vampires and the Demon Army won’t ever find us? Man, that brings back memories. Back then we were both desperate to run away from our world of vampires and slavery. So we escaped… Hoping and praying to find some paradise where we could live in peace… But all we found was this. We can’t run, Mika. There’s nowhere to run to. No matter where we go, all we’ll find is more humans and vampires.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Don’t get me wrong, I trust you guys. But I’ll still come for you. Tomorrow, the day after, and forever.” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Shinoa, I have no idea what’s going on here, but we’re all gonna help each other get out of this alive. Shinoa, what are our orders?” – Yuichiro Hyakuya
“Don’t tell me you thought we’d die that easily. Have some faith in us, will you?” – Shiho Kimizuki
“I’ll only be in it for the money. Not because we’re ‘friends.’ I won’t be your knight in shining armor. I’ll pretend to get along, and try not to vomit out of disgust.” – Shiho Kimizuki
“Demons are even less trustworthy than vampires.” – Shiho Kimizuki
” I don’t trust anybody aside from the people standing here in this circle.” – Shiho Kimizuki
“Mirai… I’m sorry. But first… can I tell you something? See, uh… Not long ago, when you weren’t around, I met this kid. His name is Yū. Can I tell you a little about him? He’s a total idiot. He drives me up the wall with everything he does. I hate his guts. He’s annoying, and he always does the stupidest things. I swear, he doesn’t have two brain cells to rub together. I can’t put up with him. But there’s this one thing… that he’s always saying. He wants to save his family. A family member of his is captured, and he wants to rescue him. They aren’t even blood-related, but he’s still risking his life to save him. Can you believe that? That’s so stupid.” – Shiho Kimizuki
“Even if it is a lie, this story makes disturbing sense. Did the Lieutenant Colonel really cause the catastrophe? Maybe. And thanks to that, my sister fell ill. Then she was used as a guinea pig. What I want to know is how does it all work.” – Shiho Kimizuki
“Okay, so how long will keeping a secret be the ‘right answer’? Are we going to try to keep it from our allies–from him–for good? I thought Lieutenant Colonel Guren would explain. But he hasn’t. And from the way this moron is acting, it looks like he doesn’t know. Shinoa. He doesn’t remember that he tried to kill you… or anything else, does he? So, here’s my question. Are we all truly friends? Is this ‘family’ thing for real? If it is, then as soon as he wakes up… I’m telling him everything.” – Shiho Kimizuki
“Wow. That must’ve been awful. Do you want to hear how I came here? Both of my parents abused me. One day, they got sick of me and threw me out of a moving car. I was brought here.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“I don’t care about the glory. You can have it.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“In the end, the best way to live down here is to be smart. You’ve got to be clever to survive.” Mikaela Hyakuya
“If my only other choice is being a vampire, then yes! I’d rather be dead!” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“The vampires don’t really care about humanity in general. It’s only specific humans like you that concern them… The kind of humans who will stop at nothing to acquire more power.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“The humans… No, the people who ran our orphanage were using me and Yu as guinea pigs in their experiments. That’s what you told me. You said they were horrible experiments that would destroy the world, so you came in and saved us. Right? But according to the Council, you were supposed to kill us. So why let us live? It jeopardizes your position. What in the world do you want with us?” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“What if one day just the Hyakuya Orphanage family got out? What if we found a world with no vampires in it at all? Wouldn’t that be great?” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“I will do whatever it takes to protect you. And to keep you out of the hands of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army. They’ve used people like us for years, Yu. Used us in their experiments. I’m sure that Guren person didn’t save you and take you in out of the goodness of his heart. We’re part of the Seraph of the End Project.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“All the other humans chose death. But you didn’t. Instead, you played dead to save your own pathetic life. That’s already a betrayal of our comrades. In the end, you just don’t want to die, right? Filthy, shameless human. If you really want to live that bad, talk. Sell out your companions for real. Where are the rest of the humans who attacked this place?” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“Shut up, Human. I didn’t do this for you. How dare you use him like this!” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“When humans dare to break a certain taboo and try to do what is forbidden, then an angel of destruction is supposed to appear. That’s what the vampires say anyway. But humans are greedy. They’ll break taboo without a second thought. That’s why the vampires went around the world, crushing any organization that tinkered with that forbidden experiment.” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“They always think they have good reasons, Yu. Hell, even serial killers convince themselves they have good reasons for murdering people!” – Mikaela Hyakuya
“Who does that Yuichiro Hyakuya think he is?! Ignoring orders! Acting on his own! How could someone like him make it into the Moon Demon Company?! I won’t stand for it!” – Mitsuba Sangu
“There is never anything correct when you’re dealing with the Hiiragi family.” – Mitsuba Sangu
“You actually like doing dumb, kiddie stuff like riding on the roof? No wonder you and Yu get along so well.” – Mitsuba Sangu
“Someone died because of me, but I wasn’t punished! I was totally useless in battle, but they promoted me! The only bad thing that ever happens to me is getting laughed at for being inferior to my elite sister!” – Mitsuba Sangu
“It’s morons like you… that I hate… more than anything! People like you… wipe out entire squads.” – Mitsuba Sangu
“Nah. He’s not actually my kid. But… I did come across him being held prisoner by vampires, so I decided to nab him. Now, he’s such a pain in the ass that I wish I hadn’t.” – Guren Ichinose
“On the battlefield, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” – Guren Ichinose
“There he is. Just like the prophecy said. One of the lab rats from Hyakuya Laboratories, the company that destroyed Japan. Boy. You are going to be of use to me in exterminating vampires.” – Guren Ichinose
“You protected that girl. Given the choice, you picked saving someone over revenge.” – Guren Ichinose
“This is the Moon Demon Company! We march on the path to Hell. Or did you only come here to play meaningless games of revenge?” – Guren Ichinose
“Listen up, everyone. During this mission, I will have zero tolerance for anyone who doesn’t follow regulations. Nor will I tolerate anyone treating this like a game or messing around. I repeat, this is not a game. This is the most difficult, dangerous mission we have ever undertaken. Some of us are going to die. We are all family here. And on this mission, we are going to lose a lot of family members. But despite that danger, this is a mission worth risking our lives for!” – Guren Ichinose
“It’s your punishment. Shinoa. This is your squad. I’m doing you a favor and teaching you that even a little mistake could kill them…. You don’t get it. You’ve never had anyone important to you before. You don’t know what it’s like to fear losing someone. But now things are different. Even a tiny mistake is enough to kill. Your little pranks could cost your family their lives.” – Guren Ichinose
“If it’s not just for revenge, I guess I can give you a sword. Find some friends, and use this to keep ’em safe.” – Guren Ichinose
“I’m not a fan of complicating things, so let’s give this a try. Those of you who die, blame yourselves for not training hard enough!” – Guren Ichinose
“Humans sin. Any human, if it’s to save those important to them, will gladly stain their hands with sin. The cost of bringing a person back from the dead is the lives of every human on the planet.” – Guren Ichinose
“You have talent. But you feel guilty because you couldn’t save your sister. That’s sapping your desire to live. But today… you’ve found enough reason. Your reason to live now… is to protect the ones who saved you today. Your friends. Revenge? Don’t let something so petty consume you. That goes for you too, Moron. Forget your old family. Because you have a new family now. Put your life on the line for the ones you see before you. The past is gone. There is only the future.” – Guren Ichinose
“As long as we stay in Japan, the army can hunt us down. Are you trying to say we should go overseas? You know humanity can’t cross the ocean anymore, right? During the catastrophe, the world’s oceans turned acidic and poisonous. Not only that, the waters are swimming with monsters even worse than Horsemen.” – Makoto Narumi
“I’ve lost my comrades because of the experiment on you, don’t joke with me about this. I will protect you at any cost, otherwise their death would be meaningless.” – Makoto Narumi
“Playtime is over, kids. Even if you’re as useless as rusty spoons, our squad will make this a success.” – Makoto Narumi
“They herd us humans together like animals. So nature takes its course and, as prey, we develop an instinctual fear of our predators. Becoming friends with a vampire is impossible for us. Think about it. Can predator and prey coexist? Do lions and sheep really lie down together? Could cats be friends with mice?” – Makoto Narumi
“I haven’t forgotten my sister. I’ll never forget.” – Yoichi Saotome
“Yuichiro is such a nice person! The whole world is empty and broken, but he refuses to give up! He keeps trying his very hardest to get his family back and to protect his friends. That’s amazing! Really, really amazing! If I hadn’t been lucky enough to become part of his family when I did, I’m sure despair and hopelessness would’ve swallowed me up and I’d be dead by now.” – Yoichi Saotome
“What does it really matter who’s what, anyway? Humans kill other humans. They always have. So how can we say vampires aren’t allowed to have friends? If they haven’t killed any of our family, I don’t see why we can’t be nice to each other.” – Yoichi Saotome
“If you’re gonna kill me, do it! But… If you’re Yuichiro’s family, then that makes you our family too!” – Yoichi Saotome
“This entire school is a training ground for the army. We keep demons in the basement. Any students who can tolerate the aura they emit without going mad are recruited. In other words, This ‘school’ is nothing more than one giant human experiment. Don’t tell me you actually thought that a ‘normal, peaceful school’ could really exist in this insane age.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Lemme see! Oh my! Is this what I think it is? It is! That legendary grade only achieved by the most special of students! Let’s show it to everybody!” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Monsters appeared suddenly and killed more people. Now, the human population has been reduced to a mere fraction of what it once was. Beyond those walls lie blasted wastelands and crumbling ruins overrun with monsters. This world of ours… no longer welcomes humanity. We of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army are bringing the remnants of humanity together to reproduce so that we can take over the world! Breed for us, civilians! Multiply! Make more babies for the sake of the Demon Army! Long live premarital and illicit relationships!” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“You have nothing to worry about, Lieutenant Colonel! Since I’m an adult, I know ignoring the whiny yipping of the weak, talentless losers is only the mature thing to do.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Getting the fullest out of your cursed gear requires copious study and training. The drugs are meant to make up for that which even the most devoted training can’t provide. But look at the world around us. We simply don’t have time for that. War has already begun.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“I have little interest in the petty power struggles of the upper ranks. I lost my elder sister to that sort of thing, after all.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Well, with your gear, Yuichiro… If you learn to use a few curses, you should be able to fill in that gap a little. However, once you are on level footing with a vampire, then what? Myself, Mitsu, Yoichi… We’re all stuck behind. We’ll be killed. That is why all of us need teamwork. Today’s encounter was an excellent lesson. We were even blessed to escape without casualties. And I am particularly happy that you, of all people, suggested a retreat. But most of all, I’m thankful that you saved my life. You are as protective of your friends as Lieutenant Colonel Guren thought.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“I see, I see! I’d expect nothing less from a daughter of the prestigious Sangu family. Not just anybody can stand around like a useless lump and still get promoted!” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“The world’s in shambles, and we can’t trust a single adult still alive. Surrounded by enemies on all sides, here we squat in a men’s room like a gang of school-age delinquents. We paint quite the picture right now, don’t you think?” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Who knows? I certainly can’t say. But just a few minutes ago, for the first time in my life, someone told me they needed me. I think I’d like to try living up to that.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“In a forsaken world such as ours, there’s hardly a person left who hasn’t lost a loved one.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Ah, so you mean the struggle for power, I assume? The one that killed my gifted sister and has consumed my brother, Kureto? Little incompetent me ran away from that chaos as quickly as my feet could take me.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“My sister didn’t care about the world. Deep down, all she wanted… was to love you. You couldn’t be together, but she still wanted you. That was what led her down the road to possession. Yet, eight years ago, the world suddenly ended. Any adult who hadn’t gotten the vaccine in time died. The Four Horsemen of John appeared out of nowhere and began killing those who survived. Vampires, fearing the loss of their food source, took control of as many cities as they could. In response to that, someone somewhere called it Armageddon. They said that divine wrath was unleashed on humanity for the sins of overpopulation and overindulgence. Everyone believes that now.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“In the end, the only ones we can trust are our friends inside this rest stop with us.” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“Excellent! Well then, let us be off on a fun-filled, vampire-slaughtering excursion!” – Shinoa Hiiragi
“You deliberately allowed them to escape. They were my seraphs. But now one is gone… and one lies dying.” – Krul Tepes
“What happened to the world? We refrained from that research, but the humans didn’t. Now that they successfully control one, what point does that taboo even hold? Are you going to continue to insist we follow ancient, outdated laws? Laws that were set down by whom, hmm? First Progenitor Sika Madu? Hah! Following the rules of the one who abandoned us.” – Krul Tepes
“Ha. Love? The only thing you love is my power.” – Krul Tepes
“A very good question. Well then, now that I have finished appeasing my self-centered little son, I suppose I shall be about my orders from the council. It is time we deployed our true army to massacre all the humans in Japan. Let the Vampire-Human War begin. You, Mika, will conveniently get ‘lost’ in all that fuss. Hide from both humans and vampires, and use that opportunity to find Yu… and go find your family member. Understood?” – Krul Tepes
“What could you possibly do to defy me? I can easily extinguish a life as puny as yours. Beyond that, you are dependent on my blood. How could you possibly defy me? Are you going to say you’d rather die than be my tool? What would happen to Yu, who’s being used by those foul humans? Will you abandon him? The countries who’ve experimented with the seraph of the end are one thing… but human foulness is not limited to any locale or group. Will you abandon Yu to his fate?” – Krul Tepes
“It worked. But do me one last favor, Vampire… Kill me. Before they capture me and torture me for more information.” – Aiko Aihara
“”Because of what you said. You called the rookie ‘Yu.’ That’s a nickname. I chose to bet on the hope that means you’re close. Protect him, Vampire. Don’t let the other bloodsuckers go to the city hall.” – Aiko Aihara
“Right now, Private Yuichiro Hyakuya… is headed for Nagoya City Hall. If you vampires head over there, all of the humans there, including Yuichiro Hyakuya, will be killed. Don’t go. Please.” – Aiko Aihara
“You were the ones who attacked first, and now you don’t want me to follow? You humans are always so selfish.” – Crowley Eusford
“Too bad. I feel for you lot… Hanging out with him with all his antics is exhausting.” – Crowley Eusford
“I was just wondering if the humans might be getting a little too powerful, too fast. See… Humans have always had a lust for power, even if it meant delving into the forbidden to get it. But were they ever this strong before? It makes me wonder. Is someone, somewhere… giving humans information they have no business having?” – Crowley Eusford
“Once those humans get here, I hope things will get more interesting.” – Crowley Eusford
“You interest me. As long as your heart stays strong, I will obey you. But if I detect even a moment’s weakness, your body is mine.” – Asuramaru
“Don’t trust humanity, Yu. Humans are more frightening than vampires. Even more frightening than demons. Heh. How odd to say that to a human.” – Asuramaru
“Love and greed intertwined. What an incredible contradiction. This is why humans destroy the world.” – Asuramaru
“Look at the sky. You’ve stained it an ugly black, spreading it over the world like a curse. Yu? Mika is right. If there is still time… both of you should run as far away from humans as you can. If you don’t, you’ll lose your humanity. Uh-oh. You’re out of time after all. The part of you that isn’t human is about to run wild.” – Asuramaru
“You know… I can’t help but think this… You are completely insane. In your hand, you hold an angel’s trumpet, but the drugs you need to control that angel’s power have transformed your whole arm into something much like a devil’s. Not only that… The whole rest of your body is being taken over by a demon. Eesh. What are you trying to become? Heck… What are you in the first place?” – Asuramaru
“I dislike the thought that my chosen master is being manipulated by someone. The Demon Army. The Hyakuya Sect. Guren Ichinose. Ferid Bathory. I don’t know who is pulling your strings, but I’d rather it was your desire that was making everyone around you dance… You have a brain. One that works even–use it. If you don’t… you won’t be able to save anyone in the end…. At least, I think that’s what your partner would say.” – Asuramaru
“Who would have thought that I, a demon, would ever be scared of how monstrous the human I’m possessing could be?” – Asuramaru

“Human beings don’t feel pain with their bodies. The brain is the thing that transmits the pain to the body.” – Madoka Shishito
“This is the law of conservation of mass. Somebody’s “happiness” is somebody else’s “unhappiness”. That’s why I tried to be a “rubbish bin” for those guys who played othello on my back using white and black thumbtacks. My crying and screaming meant something cause they were laughing… But I was wrong. It doesn’t make sense, does it? If I enjoy being unhappy, that “happiness” will make someone else “unhappy.” – Madoka Shishito

“You can’t do anything about what doesn’t exist. In the end humans settle for what’s in front of them. If you think about it, humans who were unable to do that made discoveries or inventions and advanced civilization. Planes were invented because people wanted to fly. Cars and trains came to be because people wanted easier means to move around. However, this came from a limited number of people who had innovative plans and concepts. In other words, geniuses made it all possible. Common folk like us are best off living an ordinary life.” – Kyon

“Applying knowledge is of the utmost importance when studying. You wrestle with various things and come up with a solution from there. It’s true that asking someone who knows the answer is the quickest. But you can’t necessarily say that that’s the best way, don’t you think?” – Asakura Ryouko
“I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him,”Do you know how many people are here right now”? He said probably fifty thousand, since the stadium was full. I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don’t know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn’t true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all.” – Haruhi Suzumiya

“As a musician, in the process of learning from a teacher, your differences breed a sense of discomfort which you should cherish. It’s because of those differences that we have individuality.” – Hiroko Seto
“When you say you “can’t hear the sound”, doesn’t it really mean you “aren’t restrained by the sound”? Rather than the sound you hear with your ears, an image inside you is boiling up from the depths of yourself and taking over without you even knowing. The sound inside, the landscape in your heart, your wishes, a sound loaded with your thoughts; didn’t you feel it, even for a moment? “Not being able to hear the sound.” That is a gift.” – Hiroko Seto

“A lump of steel, like a shooting star. Just seeing the same sky as you makes familiar scenery look different.

Wishes, a craving for the spotlight, feelings that one wants to deliver, feelings for one’s mother. Everyone was supported by their own feelings. I realize now that, perhaps, no one can stand alone on stage.” – Kousei Arima
“You’re like a cat. If I get close, you’ll ignore me and go far away. If I get hurt, you’ll play around to share the pain.” – Kousei Arima

“I believe in ghosts, even though I’ve never seen one before and get this. I don’t believe in anyone of the people that have said they seen one before. It’s kind of like how I think about the concept of love. Like I believe one day I’ll fall in love, get married and live happily ever after, even though I’ve never actually fallen in love with anyone yet. You see what I’m saying?

I haven’t seen one yet so maybe they’re not.” – Minori Kushieda

No matter how dangerous the long journey in life was, or how one admits to being dealt the short end of the stick, everything was the result of one’s own choices, it was a road chosen by oneself.

“The day before yesterday, I saw a rabbit. Yesterday, it was a deer. And today, it’s you.” – Kotomi Ichinose
“At a place where you feel most restful… Next to the person you find most dear. People’s lives are repetitions of inflicting pain on each other. It’s understandable to doubt others.

Are you able to laugh with an honest heart?” – Yoshino Yusuke

“If someone didn’t have any pride, wouldn’t they also be lacking in self-confidence? If someone was free of greed, wouldn’t they have trouble supporting their family? And if people didn’t envy one another, wouldn’t they stop inventing new things?” – Eru Chitanda
“If you can never get angry at anything, that probably means you have nothing that you like, either.” – Eru Chitanda

“People remember their high school days as the high point of their lives. People say these things because everyone holds fond memories of their time in high school; however, I doubt that every high school student would want to remember their school life that way.

“Now listen up, any power that surpasses reason, still comes from reason, right? Magic isn’t some kind of miraculous power. It is a talent that only works when the flow of energy inside of us and the flow of energy in the natural world are in perfect synchronization. To perform magic one must have a strong mind and the ability to focus. It should take over your being and come pouring out of your soul! If all we do is worry about following rules, then our magic will never progress.” – Makarov Dreyar

The clumsy ones will walk into more walls than the others, and it may also take them longer to get there. If you believe in tomorrow and put yourself out there, you can naturally obtain your strength. That’s how you will be able to smile and live strong.” – Makarov Dreyar

“Are you afraid of other people? I know that by keeping others at a distance you avoid a betrayal of your trust, but you must endure the loneliness. Man can never completely erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone. Pain is something man must carry in his heart, and since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe that life is pain.” – Kaworu Nagisa
“Humans constantly feel pain in their hearts. Because the heart is so sensitive to pain, humans also feel that to live is to suffer.” – Kaworu Nagisa

“I’m the one who deserved to be hit. Not you! I’m a coward. I’m dishonest. I’m sneaky. And a wimp!” – Shinji Ikari

“Sometimes you need a little wishful thinking just to keep on living.” – Misato Katsuragi
“So fu*** what if I’m not you?! That doesn’t mean it’s okay for you to give up! If you do, I’ll never forgive you as long as I live. God knows I’m not perfect either. I’ve made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them. And I’ve done it over and over again, thousands of times. A cycle of hollow joy and vicious self-hatred. But even so, every time I learned something about myself.” – Misato Katsuragi
“Never underestimate the ability of the human animal to adapt to its environment.” – Misato Katsuragi
“The one who deserves to survive is the one who has the will to make it happen. He wished for death. He ignored his will to survive and chose to die for a false hope. Your survival is not a mistake, Shinji.” – Misato Katsuragi

“So how do you measure a thing’s worth? Nostalgia and memories don’t mean sh*t. Value is determined by a universally accepted unit. Money. Any other measures of value ain’t nothing more than sentimental bullsh*t.” – Revy Rebecca
“You’ve got to enjoy life, or else you’ll end up wasting it.” – Revy Rebecca
“Rock, if you think about it, other than this, what do we really value in life? God? Love? Don’t make me laugh. When I was a brat, crawling around in that sh*thole city, it seemed God and Love were always sold out when I went looking. Before I knew better, I clung to God and prayed to Him every single night — yeah, I believed in God right up until that night the cops beat the hell out of me for no reason at all. All they saw when they looked at me was another little ghetto rat. With no power and no God, what’s left for a poor little Chinese b*tch to rely on? It’s money, of course, and guns.” – Revy Rebecca
“If you cling to life, you live in fear of death. And that fear will cloud your judgment.” – Revy Rebecca
“What a terrible story. But appropriate for our world. Sometimes I feel like I’m walking over a giant pile of sh*t. Morality and justice don’t really suit me. Words like that and what comes out of asses are surprisingly similar.” – Revy Rebecca
“If I was looking for pity I would’ve told you something a lot more colourful. The moral of the story is when you’re livin’ on the edge, that’s all that matters to you because that’s all you’ve really got. Not everyone can get off on being normal, Rock. And one more thing… All those rich fat bastards living under palm-trees – and b*tches who think that life’s only about putting on make-up. I don’t want to hear you speaking your mind from the same perspective as those hypocrites. Nothing’s worse than being treated like some wh*re by your companions. I’ll say this once. The next time you decide you’re gonna tell me what’s proper, you’ll no longer be one of us. When that happens… I am going to kill you.” – Revy Rebecca
“Justice. I can’t think of another word more loved by the people. It does have a nice ring to it. However, without ever exercising your own strength, you seek the death of others at the hands of someone else. Well, the justice you refer to smells pretty rotten to me.” – Balalaika
“I’m no saint. A sense of duty, a sense of righteousness – they’re just nuisances in life.” – Rokuro Okajima
“The name of this city is spoken of among the villains of the world. Many who come here to make a name for themselves are swallowed by the darkness, never to return. A cruel fate awaits any half-assed small time crook, who accidentally stumbles into Roanapur. Right now another sacrificial lamb has wandered too far from home. The city awaits.” – Rokuro Okajima
“God’s not at home. He’s on vacation at Vegas.” – Eda
“It’s been 35 years… since this rotten harbor town became a den of vice. Roanapur has managed to stay out of CNN’s evening news or the dinner topic of housewives only because… from the past to the present, the motives of those who’ve gathered here have always been consistent. That is, it’s in our mutual interest to lead the public eye away from our more stimulating businesses, for the peace of mind of those who are crooked. … Please remember this. If we continue suspecting each other, continue pursuing our own self-interests… who do you think will be left standing in the ring in the end? There won’t be anybody there, ladies and gentlemen. Not you, not me… Not even the ring itself.” – Mister Chang
“When you try and live it up by raising your useless self up on a podium, you end up with a march-loving idiot.” – Dutch“You can’t just erase people’s feelings.

“As long as we are under the same sky, we shouldn’t be sad when we part ways.” – Wolfgang Grimmer
“It’s impossible for humans to forget their emotions.” – Wolfgang Grimmer
“Do you have any idea how terrible the things you did really mean? Do you understand what it means to destroy a human being’s sense of good and evil? Can you even begin to comprehend what happens when you awaken the monster inside each us? People should know in their hearts that food tastes good. They should always look forward to having picnics and wonderful places on their weekends. They should think that beer tastes good after a hard day’s work. People should know how they should feel, that they’re supposed to grieve, from the bottom of their hearts when they have to bury their own child.” – Wolfgang Grimmer
“Everyone in this world carries around their own sins, and they never go away…but that doesn’t change the fact that we do what we must.” – Wolfgang Grimmer
“Don’t just follow orders! You’re men, not machines! In your hearts, you know what’s right, the answer is sitting there, waiting for you. Are you brave enough to look inside yourselves?” – Wolfgang Grimmer

“Hatred is born when people gather together.” – Johan Liebert
“How weak the mind is when it wants to forget. Maybe you didn’t forget. Maybe you’re lying. Is it a lie you tell everyone around you, or perhaps a lie you tell yourself?” – Johan Liebert
“Do you think your sin will disappear if you lie?” – Johan Liebert
“The big secret to breaking the rules is to make it look as though you’re following them.” – Johan Liebert
“There’s nothing special about being born. Not a thing. Most of the universe is just death, nothing more. In this universe of ours, the birth of a new life on some corner of our planet is nothing but a tiny, insignificant flash. Death is a normal thing. So why live?” – Johan Liebert
“What exactly is the end? The end. The end. The end. I’ve seen the end over and over. What is the end?” – Johan Liebert

Because they don’t believe they are worthless, they don’t need to raise a fist and have vengeance against fate or the world at large.” – Inspector Lunge
“What is education? Isn’t education meant to create a person that conforms to society? What kind of education must be administrated to create a human being that meets the society’s demands? Education is an experiment.” – Mikhail Petrov

“When you’re in the darkness, you only sink deeper into it. Keep the light shining.” – Kenzo Tenma

“Killing’s easier than you think; you just have to forget how sweet the sugar is.” – Rosso
“People are such strange beings. The sad memories seem to just fade away, until all a person is left with are the happier ones. People are certainly designed so conveniently.” – Eva Heinemann

“We have no choice but to accept the one and only life we’re given, no matter how cruel and heartless it might be.” – Yuri Nakamura
“This is my life. I can’t entrust it to someone, I can’t steal a new one, I can’t force it on others, I can’t forget it or erase it. I can’t stomp over it, laugh at it, or beautify it! I can’t anything! I’d have to accept my one shot at life no matter how cruel, merciless, or unfair I thought it was! Sir, don’t you understand? That is why I must fight. I must keep on fighting! Because… because I can never [slams her desk with her hands] accept that kind of life!” – Yuri Nakamura
“When we were still in the world of living, death was something that came indiscriminately and randomly. So, there was no way to fight it.” – Yuri Nakamura

“Watching TV or playing games alone is more fun. Playing along with your friends’ hobbies… Laughing at their jokes when they’re not funny… All that does is tire me out.” – Yuzuru Otonashi
“One person needed courage to face the past. Another person needed effort to make a dream come true. Yet another person needed time and friends. What about you?”- Yuzuru Otonashi
“Our lives were real! Not a single moment of them were fake! Everyone lived the best they could. We carved those memories into ourselves. Memories of living as hard as we could. No matter what kind they were, they’re the life we led. Erasing them in the blink of an eye like that… Wasn’t your life also real to you?” – Yuzuru Otonashi

The vocals screamed for me. They grieved for me. The ones who put on the act of common sense were wrong. Those who cried were right.” – Misami Iwasawa
“Ever since that day, I’ve kept this broom balanced on my fingertip.” – Shiina
“Even death can’t cure idiocy.” – Yui
“For all our sake I will sing and pee my heart out in the name of spirit!” – Yui“Working hard alone doesn’t assure you that you’ll achieve your dreams. Actually there are more cases where you don’t. Even so, working hard and achieving something is some consolation at least.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Marriage, the institution where one’s existence goes to die. All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying “I’m home!” to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say “I’m home!” if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say “I’m home!” to the hippos on the label. And if they’re talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they’re working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Food tastes best when you don’t have to work for it.” – Hachiman Hikigaya
“Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many.” Hachiman Hikigaya
“‘Slacking off’ sounds bad. However, enjoying more of your day with the time you saved by doing your job in a clever way is definitely not a bad thing. Times like that are what makes a human’s life rich. If you exaggerate, it could be called laziness, surely. However, people only become mature when they are able to balance work with enjoyment. In short, if all you care about is your job, you’re not fully mature.” – Gaap
“People can say there is a balance, a logic that everything happens for a reason… But the truth is far less designed. No matter how hard you work, when you die, you die. Some spend their entire life trying to scratch their way to the top, and still die in poverty. While others are born into wealth without ever working at all. It’s a cruel and random world. And yet the chaos is all so beautiful.” – Dante
“manga that’s just made up of other people’s ideas without any kind of resolve!” – Moritaka Mashiro
“If you want to earn something, you need to reach out for it. Pro-athletes give up their teenage years to train. Business owners put up collateral to borrow money. That’s how it always works. To make your ambitions come true, you have to take risks. The larger the ambition the greater the risk. That might involve time or enough work to affect your lifespan… So make your choice. Live in peace as a wannabe or risk losing it all to reach the very top. You’re the one who needs to decide.” – Yumeko Jabami
“I believe being an author is a lonely line of work that asks you to pass through a narrow gate alone.” – Kanako Sakurai

“I work to support my hobby. So if you asked me which I’d choose, my job or my hobby, my hobby takes priority.” – Youji Itami
“n order to obtain something, there must be something of equal value. It is the Law of Conservation in Alchemy. Back then, we believed that it was the truth of the world. However, the real world isn’t perfect, so there is not just a single law that governs everything that happens within it. It is the same for the Law of Conservation in Alchemy. Even so, I believe that people cannot obtain something without paying a price.” – Alphonse Elric
“How can you work so hard? There might be something really bad waiting for you ahead. How can you still make yourself move on despite that? The older we get…the number of annoying and troublesome things we have to face only increases- and wonderful things stop happening. In the days ahead of us… we have to bear each painful thing one at a time, conquering them…overcoming them…the power to do that just doesn’t spring out of me. The power to move ahead.” – Kai
“A miracle: something like that won’t come if you’re waiting for it. A miracle is something you work for!” – Taro Raimon
“Being able to work hard is the best talent of all.” – Hiroshi Kido
“Hard work is worthless for those that don’t believe in themselves.” – Naruto Uzumaki
“Humans were meant to work and sweat for their money after all. Those that try to get rich quickly or live at expense of others – all get divine retribution along the way. That is the lesson. But, one thing about humans is that they quickly forget the lesson they have learnt.” – Jet Black
“Do you think everyone can make their dreams come true through hard work? Hard work isn’t always rewarded.” – Atsushi Murasakibara
“As for me, I have a lot of things that I’m not good at and that I need to work on. My comrades make up for those weaknesses by help me out, and maybe that’s how we’ve found a balance in our party.” – Haruhiro
“Charging from the front isn’t the only way to cross a wall. If pushing doesn’t work, why not try pulling? Try thinking from the opposite direction, you might be able to find a new way out.” – Kou Kazamatsuri
“Math is like a puzzle or a game. There’s a clear answer, and you’re going on a journey to find it. But there are many ways to reach that answer. That’s why it’s so fulfilling when you find the solution. There are ways to find an answer promptly, or more freely. Even roundabout methods can bring you to a definite solution. The method may not be pretty, but when the answer you worked hard to discover is right, it makes you happy.” – Kaori Fujimiya
“I wonder if there really is a God… If such an entity really existed, wouldn’t all honest, hard-working people be happy?” – Vermouth
“I think having a dream, working hard, and never giving up couldn’t possibly bring misfortune.” – Miho Azuki
“I bet it’s not easy to persevere in one’s goal. I never tried, so I wouldn’t know. But to achieve a goal, one must work hard even when no one is looking. Having a dream might not be all that great.” – Fujisaki Yusuke

“Without the assurance of food, clothing and shelter, unless you’re prepared to die, there’s no other way but to work.” – Satou Tatsuhiro
“Right now, we’re all really only taking it day by day. Even if we can’t get used to things, even if we can’t win at something, even if we don’t have any excess…In order to live day by day, we work, we fail, and we succeed. Sometimes we laugh. For the blessing before our very eyes, for our friends, we’re thankful. Who knew that people could feel happiness just from living?” – Sei
“I never like to work based on trust. It takes hard work to build up trust, but only an instant to lose it. There’s no less profitable investment.” – Ushiromiya Kyrie
“What if that fruit you’ve worked so hard to nurture gets pulled off the branch the next morning? You’ll regret that you didn’t choose to harvest it the previous day instead of complaining. That regret really hurts. It’ll make you crawl through hell.” – Ushiromiya Kyrie

“While I’m here wasting time, how hard is kakarot training?” – Vegeta
“I’m saying that practically nobody feels that they’re talented. That’s what makes us strive to improve. As we strive to improve, we notice the people around us improving too, which makes us work even harder. I guess you could say friends are like rivals, in a way.” – Eli Ayase
“It’s impossible to work hard for something you don’t enjoy.” – Keiko Ayano (Silica)
“What good are dreams, if all you do is work? There’s more to life than hitting the books, I hope you know.” – Suoh Tamaki

Yes, I just have to become a prodigy.” – Ferrari Akira E“Cry when you’re sad. Laugh when you’re happy. Get angry when you don’t like something. Depend on someone when you’re depressed. Care for yourself before you care for others. Don’t hate anyone. Be proud of yourself. Stay loyal when you fall in love.” – Otonashi Maria
“You idiot. You’d gotten yourself up in a tizzy about romance, right? “Love” you experience in that state is just self-delusion. There’s no point in getting depressed over love like that.” – Kyouya Sata

“I always believed that everyone in this world was far nicer and smarter than me. That no matter how unlikeable they seemed to be, they still had a good conscience and had justifiable circumstances for acting the way they did. That’s why I hated myself for being so timid and depressed when I didn’t even have any good reason for doing so. …But now I see that there actually are people who’re despicable in every way and don’t blink twice at ruining another’s life.” – Punpun Onodera
“It is impossible to not hurt someone. Humans unconsciously hurt others by simply existing. Whether you are alive or dead, you keep hurting people. Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved might hurt them too. But if it’s someone you don’t care about, you won’t notice you’ve hurt them. What’s important is your awareness of it. It’s because you care about them, that you feel like you’ve hurt them. Caring about someone means being resolved to the fact that you’ll hurt them. The more people care for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But that’s not something to be sad about, I think it’s probably something to be proud of.” – Shizuka Hiratsuka
“People like us aren’t qualified to be involved in a dramatic incident such as a suicide. No matter how depressed you are or how much pain you’re in, you have to return to your routine, daily life. Even if you don’t come back, you’ll just end up dying in vain. A dramatic death isn’t befitting of us.” – Kaoru Yamazaki
“Lord Jiraiya only had praise for you. He was always boasting about you, saying you were like his own grandchild. He had faith that you were the one who would inherit his will, and truly believed that you would one day be a great Hokage. Lord Jiraiya will always watch over you. Even this very minute, he’s watching from somewhere. He wouldn’t be happy seeing you sad like this. So…be your usual self, the one he praised so much. Don’t stay depressed forever.

“It wasn’t the pain that hurt me. Rather, it was the feeling of me being ripped apart, and the sound of the knife plunging deep, deep into my heart. That incomparably bittersweet fear. My body shook and trembled at the thought of it. My silent weeping contained my uneasiness, my loneliness, my will to live. My tears aren’t from the pain either, or from the fear of the encounter. It was for the brush of death that I had never before experienced, but had now fallen in love with, even though I pray every night for the strength to live.” – Fujou Kirie

“I love the word “fate”. Because, you know how they talk about “fated encounters”? A single encounter can completely change your life. Such special encounters are not just coincidences. They’re definitely… fate. Of course, life is not all happy encounters. There are many painful, sad moments. But this is what I think: sad and painful things definitely happen for a reason. Nothing in this world is pointless.” – Ringo Oginome
“Tears are handy for washing away troubling and sad feelings. But when you grow up, you’ll learn that there are things so sad, they can never be washed away by tears.

“It’s because we don’t understand that we wonder what the other is thinking and try desperately to understand every word they say… You end up thinking too much about the other person, and being close to them becomes painful so you try to distance yourself… I believe you become friends with somebody by doing that over and over, and that’s how… As much as I hate to admit it, it’s how I became friends with these guys.” – Maki Honoka

“Will you choose that ticket and live on as a man? Or will you choose this one and go back to being a woman? No matter what you choose, I’m sure you will continue to waver.

“I believe there are many things in this world that people haven’t seen yet. If you really want to see something, there’s nothing you can’t see. You can’t see it because you’re closing your eyes on purpose. Because if you use your eyes to see it, it’ll be painful, and sad. That’s why they’re closed in the first place. I think photography is like borrowing someone else’s eyes. So even if your eyes are closed… you can borrow someone else’s.” – Maria Oosawa

“Your happiness is your own business. Its a promise you make to yourself. It is a reward you give yourself for accomplishing what you set out to do, for achieving what you strive for. But if you fail to reward yourself for what you have accomplished, then you are essentially breaking a promise to yourself. Its like a breach of contract, compensation must always be made. You must pay all of the debts that you made, even to yourself.” – Yuuko ichihara
“If you’re gonna have great happiness, it requires great effort in exchange, that’s called compensation. For the good things in life, there are the bad. For the bad things in life, there are always the good. In order for you to be happy, you must be willing to accept a burden of a equal amount of unhappiness in exchange as your payment. The more you achieve, the greater the demands will be placed upon you in return.” – Yuuko Ichihara

“There is no such thing as “truth” or “lies” in this world; there never has been. There are only plain, hard facts. And yet, all beings who exist in this world acknowledge only those “facts” that are convenient to them, and take them to be the “truth”. They do so because they know no other way of living. However, for those powerless beings who comprise the majority of this world’s population, inconvenient facts that affirm their very existence, are their only truth.” – Sosuke Aizen
“Admiration is the furthest thing from understanding.” – Sosuke Aizen

“We think the flower on the precipice is beautiful, because our fear makes our feet stop at its edge, instead of stepping forward into the sky, like that flower.” – Sosuke Aizen
“I guess it’s only natural for inferior beings to ride on the coattails of their superior counterparts. If they wish to keep their lives, they have no choice but to obediently comply. It’s a never ending chain… as the ones who are burdened with that trust, in order to escape that burden, seek to find someone even greater than themselves. These greater beings then seek others even greater than themselves to shelter them. This is how Gods are born. But make no mistake. They all still abide to me. Because from this point onward, you will witness first hand, the power of the God they foolishly placed their faith in. I will become that God they have no choice but to believe in.” – Sosuke Aizen

“Training hard, risking your life… what’s the difference?” – Kisuke Uruhara
“I’m so disappointed, Ichigo, so very disappointed. Sadly, your sword exhibits only fear. When you counter, it’s because you fear being killed. When you attack, you fear killing. And when you protect someone, you fear you could let them die. At this point, the only thing your sword speaks is senseless fright, and that’s not good. What you don’t need in battle is fear. Nothing will come of it.” – Kisuke Uruhara
“If you ask anyone to name a universal rule that governs animals and humans alike, I bet you most people would answer “survival of the fittest”. There are strong people and there are weak people. At a glance, it looks like the difference is pretty clear-cut. But the truth is, there’s a lot more to it than just a simple battle of “strong” against “weak”, of kill or be killed. You must understand what I’m talking about too, right? The true meaning of “survival of the fittest” isn’t as simple as all that.” – Riruka Dokugamine
“Survival of the fittest’ is just a pretty lie that they tell you. A lie to make weak people believe that if they try their best, they can come out on top. Truth is, it isn’t the weak that get eaten. It’s not about strength, it’s about numbers. The ones who stand at the top of the food chain are the brainless dolts. The loudmouths. Because there are so, so many of them. You know it’s true. Everybody does. You all just turn a blind eye and pretend not to notice.” – Riruka Dokugamine
“Do you know what a scientist fears most in this world above all else? It’s oblivion, my friend. A scientist measures our lives in the ways we develop and expand our knowledge through myriad variations. Nothing can take its place. It’s our very soul. I have done the worst thing one scientist can do to another: I have altered your thought process. When my drug takes effect, you will find your mind has lost the ability to think.” – Kurotsuchi Mayuri
“There is no such thing as perfect in this world. That may sound cliche, but it’s the truth. The average person admires perfection and seeks to obtain it. But what’s the point of achieving perfection? There is none. Nothing. Not a single thing. I spit on perfection! If something is perfect, then there is nothing left. There is no room for imagination. No place left for that person to gain additional knowledge or abilities. Do you know what that means? For scientists such as us, perfection only brings despair.

“You are a fool, Ichigo Kurosaki. You willingly seek to challenge an opponent so much more powerful than you that it strikes a primal fear into your being. Incomprehensible.

“It’s just that… It’s just that not being able to fight with everyone makes me feel lonely!

“There were a lot of things I wanted to do. I wanted to become a teacher, and an astronaut, and a baker… I wanted to go to a bunch of different donut shops and ask for one of everything! And I wanted to tell the ice-cream man to give me one of everything, too! I wish I could have five different lives! Then I could have been born in five different towns, and eaten five lifetime’s worth of food, and had five different careers, and… fallen in love with the same person, five times.” – Orihime Inoue
“I can’t deny, I don’t know very much about Rukia. That’s not the point, I might not risk my life for her, but Ichigo wants to save her life and that’s all I need to know. What may seem like an unworthy cause to you is more than enough reason for me.” – Yatsutora Sado

“There are two kinds of fights. As long as we place ourselves in battle, we must always know the difference, a fight to defend life or a fight to defend pride.” – Jushiro Ukitake
“Let me tell you the truth. The truth behind fighting. Fighting continues forever. After you’ve defeated one person, someone stronger appears. If you manage to defeat him, then an even stronger person comes along. If you don’t have the resolve to endure that eternal struggle, then eventually your confidence will erode. But it doesn’t end there! The battle will continue elsewhere, fought by others. It’s an endless cycle! And it doesn’t end with a person’s death. The cycle will continue!

“No matter what I attempt, even if it’s the most simple of tasks, it always ends in failure. Unfortunately, I find that my life is one big regret after another. Yet, after all these years, I still don’t know when to give up. Is it my fault to keep trying when the results are always the same? Is it impossible for me to make things right?

“The reason that I’m no good… Even though I can’t do anything well, I will attempt it anyways. Even though I decide not to try anymore, I regret it, and end up trying again. After all, I can’t do anything right, it’s better if I just don’t try at all. I’m an idiot, aren’t I.” – Miranda Lotto

Assuming that good fortune will come to you is no different than pointing a finger at a random person and predicting the same for them.

“I hate the word “fate.” Birth, encounters, partings, success and failures, fortune and misfortunes in life. If our lives are already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born? There are those born to wealthy families, those born to beautiful mothers, and those born into the middle of war or poverty. If that’s all caused by fate, then God is incredibly unfair and cruel.

“Books are nice, aren’t they? With just one sentence you can get lost in all sorts of dreams. The way I think of it, literature allows the reader’s consciousness to deeply relish the author and be closer to him.

We’re all to blame.” – Kaneki Ken
“Donato has to keep proving himself. He wants to prove just how valuable he is. Isn’t that the case with you as well? Because you are the same as Donato.

“Rock, if you think about it, other than this, what do we really value in life? God? Love? Don’t make me laugh. When I was a brat, crawling around in that shithole city, it seemed God and Love were always sold out when I went looking. Before I knew better, I clung to God and prayed to Him every single night — yeah, I believed in God right up until that night the cops beat the hell out of me for no reason at all. All they saw when they looked at me was another little ghetto rat. With no power and no God, what’s left for a poor little Chinese bitch to rely on? It’s money, of course, and guns.” – Revy Rebecca

To slay a dragon is the greatest of honors.” – Koko Hekmatyar

And yet the chaos is also beautiful.” – Dante

“I am looking at things from a much higher perspective than you. I observe this world, this universe, the truth of all things. And I have realized that humans must be destroyed.

“Being angry consumes energy and makes me tired. So I’d rather apologize, even if I’m not at fault. Besides, we get along, and we both want to stay friends. Prolonging an awkward situation out of stubbornness is just silly.” – Tanaka
